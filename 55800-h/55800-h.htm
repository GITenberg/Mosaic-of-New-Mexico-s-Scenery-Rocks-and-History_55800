<h2><span class="small">Preface</span></h2>
<p>Previous <i>Scenic Trips to the Geologic Past</i> have emphasized scenic
tours of local areas in New Mexico. This book lays out a mosaic of facts
and fancies concerning the state&rsquo;s landscapes, the rocks that underlie and
make up the landscapes, and the history of the people now living or who
have lived amid New Mexico&rsquo;s exciting and varied scenery. We hope
these short articles will help you enjoy our state, whether you are a tourist
driving through at seventy miles an hour, a visitor with a little time
to explore, or an old-timer who remembers the cattle drives.</p>
<p>The idea for this publication grew out of a booklet, <i>New Mexico
Mosaic of Science and History</i>, that was written for the 1963 National
Science Fair-International held in Albuquerque. The National Science
Fair booklet was directed specifically to the Fair participants and emphasized
their tours to famous scientific installations in New Mexico,
areas of scenic geologic wonders, and points of historic and archeologic
importance. The booklet had only limited distribution; subsequent interest
in this kind of publication about New Mexico led to the preparation of
this book.</p>
<p>Scenic Trips No. 8 is in two major parts. First, there are articles of general
statewide interest to acquaint visitor and resident alike with the
Land of Enchantment&mdash;its history, flora and fauna, geology, and scenic
beauty. Second, there are articles describing specific scenic, geologic, historic,
and recreational places to give a depth of understanding and a more
intimate view of New Mexico. The entire mosaic of New Mexico thus
presented is a permanent record to recall vistas of New Mexico&rsquo;s enchanting
land and fascinating history.</p>
<h4>Acknowledgments</h4>
<p>Many people have contributed their time and talents to this co-operative
undertaking. We thank each of the authors of the articles; where their
affiliation is not given, they are staff members of the New Mexico Bureau
of Mines and Mineral Resources division of the New Mexico Institute of
Mining and Technology. Professor Christiansen is a member of the
Humanities Department of the Institute&rsquo;s College division. This book
would have been incomplete without the co-operation of the New Mexico
Department of Game and Fish, the Museum of New Mexico, the New
Mexico Department of Development, the State Park Commission, the U.S.
Park Service, and the Forest Service, Southwestern Region, U.S. Department
of Agriculture. Our special appreciation goes to Dr. Ross Calvin
for his interpretative description of New Mexico&rsquo;s unique flora.</p>
<p>Black and white photographs were contributed by Robert Bieberman,
Roy Foster, and Teri Ray of the Bureau of Mines staff and by the authors
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
or their agencies. Some of the drawings were made by David H. Moneypenny.
Acknowledgment is also made to Mr. Elliott S. Barker and the
Forest Service for their willing loan of color transparencies.</p>
<p>Among the numerous personnel of the New Mexico Institute of Mining
and Technology who aided in preparation of this book, appreciation is
due Helen Waxler, Lois Devlin, Lola White, Mary Ann Grandjean, and
Sharon Ballenger for typing of manuscripts and William Arnold, Robert
Price, and Raymond Molina for drafting maps and figures. Teri Ray
deserves special mention for her interest and editorial advice and for nursing
the material from rough manuscripts into printed pages.</p>
<h3>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h3>
<p>The kind reception given our attempt to provide a brief but comprehensive
guide to New Mexico&rsquo;s scenery, rocks, and history resulted in
distribution of 5000 copies in two years, and led to this second edition. In
this revision, we have incorporated changes that have occurred during
these two years, especially the addition of State Parks, and Teri Ray has
added an index to make the book more usable. Each author has re-edited
his article and made changes where necessary. William Arnold added
much material to the index map; typing of the revision manuscript was
carefully done by Lois Devlin. Alfred Coulloudon and Wayne Bera supplied
additional photographs. Teri Ray initiated revision of the first edition,
worked with authors, and guided the manuscript from the authors to
the final copy.</p>
<h3>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION</h3>
<p>The first edition appeared in 1964, the second in 1967, and a reprint in
1968. In the present edition front matter has been re-styled, printed matter
has been altered on the inside and outside of the covers, a footnote added to
<a href="#Page_104">page 104</a>, and a less bulky paper used.</p>

<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">Paige W. Christiansen</span></p>
<p>In the world of the twentieth century with its tumultuous ovation for
each discovery of science, with its language of non-Euclidian space, with
new heroes who leave the earth, not discover it&mdash;sometimes it is refreshing
to look back on other days, to see other heroes, and to seek romance and
excitement which was equally spectacular in times past. Yet there is a close
affinity and a spiritual link among the heroes of the past, the present, and
the future, and the reaction of their contemporaries to their feats of glory
is not so different. Heroes are those who seek the unknown, who risk life
and position to expand the frontiers of man&rsquo;s universe and mind. But
heroes can only lead an age, never surpass it. History, then, is people and
their catalyst, ideas.</p>
<p>The history of New Mexico, like twentieth century science, is multi-dimensional.
Its complex cultural patterns fit with the intricate variety of
its geologic wonders and its flora and fauna. In reality, New Mexico is
a part of a broader concept, the Southwest. This vast region, which includes
western Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, southern California, part of
southern Colorado, and southern Utah, has given rise to some of man&rsquo;s
greatest achievements. Here prehistoric man rose above his animal heritage
to take control of these lands. Here, also, many millennia later, man
achieved one of his greatest scientific wonders, the successful release of
atomic energy. The story of the years between these events, so far separated
in time, is a wondrous tale.</p>
<h3>INDIAN BEGINNINGS</h3>
<p>Before the coming of the white man, this land belonged to nature&rsquo;s
children, the Indian. Centuries before European nations came into existence,
peoples from Asia, crossing by the Bering waters, had discovered, explored,
and settled the American continents from Alaska to Tierra del
Fuego. They mastered the plains, the northern forests, the jungles of
Central and South America, and the arid regions. In the deserts and mountains
of the Southwest, they conquered elements and terrain, first to survive
and then slowly to ascend the ladder of culture.</p>
<p>At first they were foragers, living on what nature provided. At the
time of Christ, several groups could be distinguished: In the Colorado
River drainage, south of the Grand Canyon, were the Yuman Foragers;
in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico were the Mogollon
people; in the Four Corners area (where the states of Utah, Colorado,
Arizona, and New Mexico meet) and in the Rio Grande Valley of New
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
Mexico was a complex of cave sites that evidenced a forager type of culture.
But, as man always aspires to rise above his environment, the Indian
slowly and painfully learned to make tools, developed new techniques,
and finally made the great step upward; he domesticated plants. Agriculture,
based primarily on the growing of corn, came to the Four Corners
before the Christian era. Gradually, out of the primitive foragers, there
developed across the Southwest a complex pattern of agricultural societies;
peaceful farmers intent upon harvesting the utmost from a harsh land. In
Arizona, the Hohokam peoples created a culture based upon irrigation. In
the valleys of the upper Gila and Mimbres rivers of southwestern New
Mexico, several branches of the Mogollon culture grew and prospered.
In the Four Corners area and in the upper Rio Grande Valley, the Mesa
Verde, the Gran Chaco, and later the Rio Grande branches developed, at
first in the cliffs of the high country, then in open villages along the main
tributaries of the Rio Grande. That there were numerous and varied cultures
is attested to by the ruins one finds scattered throughout the Southwest.
Along now dry arroyos, on buttes overlooking rivers or dry river
beds, among cliffs in the mountain fastnesses and in caves wherever they
appear, there are thousands of sites whose people and history are lost in
antiquity.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="499" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Prehistoric Indian cliff dwelling</span></p>
</div>
<p>And these people were builders. They lived in caves at first, then in
crude pit houses. Finally they moved above the ground and evolved
building techniques and styles of architecture that stood the ravages of
time and still serve the people of the Southwest. In the city of Santa Fe,
the Palace of the Governors was built upon the ruins of an Indian pueblo
(village), the name of which has disappeared even from tradition, and its
massive walls of puddled adobe, laid down before the art of making bricks
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
was introduced by the Spanish, may be seen under glass in some of the
rooms of the Palace at the present time. Perhaps most spectacular are the
great houses of Chaco Canyon, some of which must have sheltered from
one to two thousand people each, and which as achievements in building,
both from the standpoint of durability and graceful construction, rival the
structures of the historic valleys and plateaus of the ancient eastern world.</p>
<p>In addition to agriculture and building, the Indian of the Southwest
achieved great heights in artistic forms. The ceramics of the American
Southwest become increasingly important when compared with products of
the Old World. The Indians of America and the Southwest are a race of
artists. Their aesthetic culture towers above anything achieved by the
white man, with the general exception of ancient Greece and Renaissance
Italy.</p>
<p>As impressive as his achievements in domesticating plants, in building
massive structures, and in developing symbolism and aesthetic values to
match his material advances, the Indian&rsquo;s greatest heights were reached
in his philosophy on nature and life. He conceived himself to be, not
master of creation, but a single factor in the scheme of things. He shared
with all things&mdash;beasts, birds, rocks, trees, everything in nature&mdash;a life
principle which permeated all, a gift conferred by the mighty powers of
earth and sky. He observed orderly procession of natural phenomena and
ordered his own life in harmony therewith. His was no egocentric point
of view which has become so much a part of the philosophic base of the
European mentality. His natural philosophy entered into every facet of
his life&mdash;his daily work, his art, his ceramics, his religion. In short, this
singularly fine outlook upon the world helps to account for his success
in conquering the diverse elements of earth and sky which constantly
threatened his very existence.</p>
<p>But this fine culture did not survive in the fullness of its bloom. What
eventually destroyed the vast and complicated agricultural system was not
the rigors of Mother Nature but a migration of new people into the flow
of Southwest history. Sometime after 1000 A.D., a nonfarming, nomadic,
warlike people entered the Southwest. The peaceful farmers, weakened
by drouth, were unable to cope with this new force. Gradually they fell
back, leaving behind their homes, their fields, their culture. By 1300, only
a small remnant remained, that located in the Rio Grande Valley of north-central
New Mexico. Across the rest of the Southwest the nomadic tribes,
technically called <i>Athapascan</i> from their linguistic affiliation but better
known by their modern name, <i>Apache</i>, had replaced the farming cultures.
The picturesque Indian pueblos we see today in the valleys of northern
New Mexico are the direct descendants of the great cultures that existed
at Mesa Verde, Gran Chaco, Frijoles, and other centers of cultural
achievement.</p>
<p>The Indians of the Rio Grande Valley and the Apache who controlled
most of the Southwest managed an uneasy coexistence. The Pueblo Indians
remained basically farmers, holding fast to the cultural advances
made by their ancestors during the millennium preceding 1300. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Apache, for the most part, remained nomadic predators, living off nature&rsquo;s
bounty, or better still, raiding the pueblos for food. The Apache groups
began to take on names and traditional areas which they called their own.
In northern New Mexico were the Jicarilla Apache and in the southeast,
the Lipan, the Mescalero, and the Natage Apache. In northeastern Arizona
were the Navajo and in the drainage of the Gila River, the Chiricahua,
the Gila, and other groups of the Western Apache. Each of these
groups made its mark upon the face of the land.</p>
<h3>SPANISH CONTRIBUTIONS</h3>
<p>This was the situation in the Southwest when the sixteenth century
opened, but a new force was abroad which would grow and strengthen
and leave a deep imprint on New Mexico. Beginning on the wild islands of
the Caribbean and then fanning out into the heart of Mexico and the
South American continent, this new force spread across the face of
America. Europeans, more exactly, Spaniards, came bent upon conquest
for its own reward, for the glory of God, and for gold. These sturdy men
from the Iberian peninsula with weapons vastly superior to the Indians&rsquo;,
with the horse which made them highly mobile and devastating in battle,
and with tactics and precision in warfare unknown among the Indians,
were to sweep without serious setback across the great cultures of Mexico
and Central and South America. By 1540, they were ready to take their
next leap forward.</p>
<p>On the west coast of Mexico, at a place called Culiacan, a colorful
host gathered. In their ears rang the words of the legend of the Seven
Cities of Cibola, seven golden cities, a legend which had been popular in
Spain for many generations. Mexico City had produced wealth, and the
Spanish were ready to believe that other fabulous cities existed. One Spaniard
had already crossed part of North America and had heard from the
Indians tales of the rich cities. His name was Cabeza de Vaca, and the
exuberance of his tales fired the imagination of the Spaniards.</p>
<p>The soldiers and adventurers gathering in Mexico, commanded by
Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, were the first Europeans to organize an
expedition to the American Southwest. Leaving from Culiacan in 1540,
they went up the west coast of Mexico into modern Arizona, then east
into New Mexico. The seven golden cities turned out to be the pueblos
around Zuni, New Mexico, and not golden at all. The expedition, although
discouraged, marched into the Rio Grande Valley and visited most of the
pueblos there. Still they failed to find the treasure they sought. In a final
desperate attempt, they explored onto the Great Plains, eventually reaching
central Kansas. Broken in spirit and body, they struggled back to the
Rio Grande Valley, and then retraced their route to Mexico. In all, the
expedition covered a two-year span. A failure? Yes, in terms of wealth and
treasure found. Yes, in terms of conquest, for nothing had been conquered.
No, in terms of human resources, for the Indians Coronado met were to
be the incentive that would bring the Spaniard back to New Mexico.
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
While the Spaniard did seek gold and glory, he also burned with a missionary
zeal and sought souls for his deep-running religion, Roman
Catholicism.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="489" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Mesa top pueblo</span></p>
</div>
<p>For fifty-five years after Coronado, interest in New Mexico and the
Southwest was spotty. Other things occupied the Spanish&mdash;primarily silver
discoveries in the central valleys of Mexico. But men did not forget New
Mexico and saw there an opportunity for missionary activity and exploitation.
Also, other nations of Europe were beginning to take an interest in
the North American continent, and New Mexico began to look attractive
to the Spanish as a frontier defensive outpost. The frontier line pushed
ever northward from central Mexico. By 1595, the Spanish were ready to
push a salient into New Mexico.</p>
<p>From among the mining communities of northern Mexico, a force of
two hundred colonists was assembled by Don Juan O&ntilde;ate who had a contract
to colonize New Mexico. After countless delays due to politics and
supply shortages, the O&ntilde;ate expedition left Chihuahua in 1598. The route
went north across the desert to the Rio Grande near El Paso del Norte
(modern Juarez), thence up the Rio Grande into New Mexico. On August
18, 1598, they arrived at San Juan, and there founded the first capital of
New Mexico, San Juan de los Caballeros. These lands of the Southwest
so long colored by the Indian now received a new imprint, one that would
alter the direction and flow of culture and change it from the Indian to the
Spanish Southwest.</p>
<p>From San Juan, and later (1610) from Santa Fe, O&ntilde;ate, his men, and
his colonists brought New Mexico under the Spanish yoke. In co-operation
with the Franciscan Order, which had been assigned the task of converting
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
the Indian, O&ntilde;ate supervised the building of missions and mission
churches at many of the pueblos of New Mexico. At the same time, Spanish
towns developed, the most important being the new capital at Santa
Fe. By 1628, New Mexico was solidly in the hands of her new masters.</p>
<p>The period from 1628 to 1680 was one of internal conflict and isolation
for New Mexico. It lay far out on the frontier, alone and distant
from its source of supplies. It lacked many of the items necessary for frontier
life, particularly hardware and clothing. Its population was small, and
in constant fear of Indian uprising, and its officials were too weak to act
with vigor. Finally, there was a lack of genuine interest on the part of
the central authorities. All these problems led to internal conflicts between
soldier and colonist; between colonist and Indian; between colonist and
official; and, perhaps most bitter of all, between church and state. This
latter conflict would erupt time after time, openly, and with bitterness
and denunciation from both sides. Governors were excommunicated as
heretics; Franciscans were accused of all sorts of crimes and improper behavior.
This, plus the other conflicts, gave rise to growing disrespect by
the Indians for their European conquerors. The superiority of Christianity
was questioned by the Indians as they watched the attacks and counterattacks
made by priest and governor. The whole system of Spanish rule
seemed a mockery. In 1680, the Indians decided their way was best after
all and rose in rebellion.</p>
<p>Led by Po-p&eacute; from Taos, the various pueblos banded together in a
mighty effort to remove the Spanish from traditional Indian lands. For
the first time the pueblos came together, united by a single purpose. There
were two exceptions; Isleta, just south of Albuquerque, and the Piro villages
farther south (Socorro) remained loyal to the Spanish. Up and down
the Rio Grande Valley, the Spaniards fell before the pent-up anger of the
Indians. Survivors gathered at Santa Fe, but their water supply was cut,
and they were forced to retreat south. At Isleta and later at the Piro villages,
they received aid before continuing south to El Paso del Norte.
With them went their Indian allies from Isleta and Socorro. It was a total
defeat for the Spanish, and the Indian again was master of New Mexico.</p>
<p>But not for long, for at El Paso there gathered a force dedicated to
revenge for their comrades who had died before the Indian onslaught.
Ably led by Diego de Vargas, this expedition moved into New Mexico in
1692. The Indians, who had achieved such unity for the moment in 1680,
were again badly divided. De Vargas, instead of having to subdue an
alliance, had only to deal with one pueblo at a time. Very quickly New
Mexico was returned to a mission area and frontier military post. The
Pueblo Indians became permanently subjected to European domination.
Their one and only attempt at unity had, in the final analysis, failed.</p>
<p>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, New Mexico was
the heart of the Spanish empire in the Southwest. Only in southwestern
Arizona, western Texas, and California did the Spanish hold any land other
than in the upper Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico. During these centuries,
this valley complex played out its dual role of mission area and military
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
outpost. Its only connection with the resources and ideas of the world
was a long hazardous road that stretched from Santa Fe to Chihuahua City
and then south to Mexico City. This was New Mexico&rsquo;s Royal Road, and
over it moved everything needed by soldier, priest, and civilian. The trade
was dominated by the merchants of Chihuahua, and New Mexico suffered.
The tale of New Mexico during this period was one of poverty,
hardship, and warfare. And several vital forces moved across the land.</p>
<p>One of these forces had long been in the Southwest, but latent. The
Spanish adopted an Indian word meaning <i>enemy</i> to describe it&mdash;Apache!
The Spanish brought with them domesticated animals which quickly
adapted to conditions of the New World and became available to the Indian.
Most important was the horse, at least as far as the Apache was
concerned. By the early eighteenth century, the Apache, and other groups
on the plains, had adapted to the use of the horse. While dangerous as
foot soldiers, the Apache became vastly more dangerous as mounted warriors.
Whereas they had been satisfied with minor raids against the pueblos
and the Spanish holdings prior to 1700, they exploded on a wave of terrorism
during the eighteenth century which very nearly drove the Spanish
from the frontier. Late in the century, the conflict between the Apache
and the Spanish became increasingly bitter. The history of the Southwest
became the history of incessant Indian incursions and Spanish attempts
to control the raiders. The missions declined and in many instances gave
way entirely to the presidio or fort. In New Mexico the military came to
dominate the missionary, and only through the heroic efforts of the meager
force at the Presidio of Santa Fe did the Spanish manage to hold New
Mexico from total collapse. A poor province became poorer, population
declined, both among the Spanish and Indian, and the future looked dark
indeed.</p>
<p>Far from New Mexico, other forces were stirring which would have a
profound effect on the province and the Southwest. Spain and the Spanish
empire were in trouble. Spain had failed to develop the supply capability
to keep her colonies alive and was forced to spend her wealth in
other areas of Europe. After two and a half centuries, the cumbersome
and inefficient colonial administrative machinery was breaking down.
While Spain&rsquo;s star was descending, other European nations were on the
move. England, France, Holland, and Russia were contesting with Spain
for control of the New World. England and France were digging in on
the east coast of North America; Holland was penetrating the islands of
the Caribbean, and Russia was pushing down the Pacific Coast from
Alaska. The weakness of Spain and the failure of her colonial government,
plus help from Napoleon by way of his invasion of the Iberian Peninsula
in 1808, brought about the collapse of the Spanish empire. In America,
patriots, inspired by the earlier success of the American Revolution and
afire with the ideas of the French Revolution, struck out at the remnants
of Spanish rule. By 1825, all the Spanish colonies but the islands of the
Caribbean were free and independent nations. New Mexico and the
Southwest became part of the Mexican state.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Almost immediately, Mexico, without leaders, without a political heritage
to lead it to stability, and torn by power struggles large and small,
was plunged into a period of political anarchy and civil war which would
last for half a century. The problems and dangers of a far-flung frontier
were lost in the din of conflict, and New Mexico became a forgotten
province. Its claims as a mission area were so weak as to be almost nonexistent.
It was no longer needed as a military outpost, for the danger to
Mexico was not external, but internal. Its reasons for being were forgotten,
at least for the moment, and New Mexico had to survive on her own initiative.
But for one very important fact, the Spanish salient into the Southwest
might have collapsed under the weight of poverty and Indian attacks.
That fact was the opening of the Santa Fe Trail in 1821, a trail which
linked the Spanish world with the Anglo-Saxon world then pushing its
frontiers out from Missouri. This trail, so rich in lore and adventure, so
much a part of the history of both the American west and the Spanish
north, was the door through which passed the characters for the final act
in the history of the Southwest.</p>
<p>Before the final act, however, it is vital and necessary to set down the
contribution of two hundred fifty years of Spanish occupation and rule.
The coming of the Spaniard to the Southwest began a mixture of white
and red races which resulted in a new mixed race. The first generation
of those who came up from Mexico were Caucasians; their descendants
were usually not. They came seeking wealth and security, but there was
neither wealth nor security in New Mexico, and they remained poor, very
poor. The society that evolved was to be based upon farming and stock
raising, and its organization was to be feudal in nature. There would be
no education; hence, there could be no intellectual advance. The world
began to go ahead of the people of New Mexico. Only in the house of
the rico was there any sign of the wealth and grandeur of Spain; everywhere
else was poverty. Farming was left in the hands of the Indian, while
the Spaniard chose to be a man on horseback, a cattleman, an aristocrat.
In the final analysis, Spanish New Mexico would not develop as democratic
and agricultural, but aristocratic and feudal. The hacienda was a
part of old Spain in exile. The rico tried vainly to hold to his idea of
chivalry and to a decorum suitable to his position. But what chance was
there in the face of the increasing poverty, the constant danger to life
and property, and time that did not move? While individual courage of the
upper class remained, discipline and industry died. When the American
army marched into the Southwest, the sons of the conquistadores could
offer no armed resistance. Perhaps the most amazing thing about the society
of the ricos in New Mexico was that it failed to contribute any lasting
monument. It left no art, no music, no great highways, no adequate
governmental system.</p>
<p>But many elements of Spanish culture were to persist, and these arose
from the collective consciousness of the people of New Mexico. Around the
great haciendas were small villages with their artisans and workers. It
was among these people that the heritage of Spain clung to this land.
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Many of these towns yet remain and are not much different from those of
two hundred years ago. To a large degree, their Spanish culture seems
hidden and undiscovered, but the people, their loves and hates, pleasures
and hopes, beliefs and fears, are governed by tradition, a tradition that
finds its roots deep in the soil of Spain.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Old mission church at Isleta Pueblo</span></p>
</div>
<p>Today, when we look at the cultural scene in New Mexico, we can
see direct evidence of Spanish occupation. The language of half the people
in the state is Spanish, in some areas still the Spanish of the sixteenth
century. Roman Catholicism, of which the Spanish were the most Catholic,
dominates the religious scene. The Spanish heritage in political attitudes,
in building and architecture, and in the legal tradition of the state is apparent.
New Mexico, of all the states in the United States, is the only one
that can claim a truly Spanish heritage.</p>
<h3>ANGLO-AMERICAN VIGOR</h3>
<p>While Spain lost its empire and New Mexico and the Southwest sank
into poverty and decay, yet another force was on the march, a force that
welled up in an Anglo-American people clinging to the Atlantic Coast
of North America. As these people developed a nation, they also discovered
a sense of destiny which turned their faces to the west and their
footsteps toward the sunset. With them moved their culture. At first, it
was a trickle, a few traders bent on profit, crossing the plains on the Santa
Fe Trail. Then the trickle became a flood. For New Mexico, these men
came as saviors. The Missouri traders broke the Chihuahua monopoly and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
goods from all parts of the world began to flow into New Mexico, resulting
in higher standards of living. These Yankee traders, sensing a good
thing, also penetrated the markets of Mexico, using New Mexico&rsquo;s Royal
Road to gain entrance.</p>
<p>Again there was conflict, not Spanish and Indian, but Latin and
Anglo-American. Mexico owned the lands of the Southwest and intended
to keep them. But this American, with his gaze glued on western skies,
refused to turn aside, and he strode on, grinding the feeble efforts of
Mexican resistance into the desert sands. The Mexican War in 1846, suddenly
transferred ownership of Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Arizona,
and California from Mexico to the United States. This was nearly
half the territory of Mexico. New Mexico, with her already complex cultural
pattern, was subjected to still another influence.</p>
<p>The history of the American occupation of the Southwest is as complex
and diverse as its predecessors. Its ingredients include cattle, mining, railroads,
agriculture, science, and the Indian. All these, and others, combined
to give an Anglo-American slant to the Southwest. The Indian culture
did not disappear, nor did the Spanish, but rather a new stratum was cast
that was to complete the mosaic.</p>
<p>When the American arrived in New Mexico, he found a poor, backward
area, hungry for trade and outside contacts. He found the Indians
of the Southwest in open rebellion against the white men. The Navajo
and other Apache groups, the Comanche, and some of the Pueblos were
the primary offenders. This was to be the main problem occupying the
time and energy of the American settler and soldier for forty years after
1846. Until the Indian situation was stabilized, there would be little economic
and social development.</p>
<p>The method evolved for containing the vicious raids against friendly
Indian, Spanish, and American communities was a series of forts placed
at strategic passes or trails surrounding the traditional lands of the Apache.
The Indian strongholds were located primarily in the mountainous regions
of southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona. The line of forts
stretched along the Rio Grande south of Socorro to the vicinity of Las
Cruces, and west along the southern edge of the mountain escarpment
into Arizona. Then the defense complex ran north across the desert to an
irregular line running east from Flagstaff through Gallup and back to the
Rio Grande. These forts were well garrisoned and provisioned and began
to carry the fight to the Indian. Early success was halted by the conflict
generated by the American Civil War.</p>
<p>The center of the Civil War in the west was in New Mexico. There was
conflict, argument, and some small degree of fighting in other western
states and territories as settlers from the north or south struggled to carry
this territory or that state into the Union or the Confederacy. These were,
however, local matters and as much political as military. In New Mexico,
there was a war and there were battles, battles which deserve to be a part
of the general Civil War story but that are usually forgotten in the smoke
and roar of eastern cannon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Two major battles were fought in New Mexico, the first a Confederate
victory, the second a Union victory which saved New Mexico, and the
west, for the Union. The aim of the Confederate forces was to capture,
intact if possible, the forts in New Mexico and Arizona with their great
store of military provisions, provisions badly needed by the Confederate
army. Also, there was a feeling among southern leaders that success in New
Mexico might also lead to success in California, badly split on the question
of secession, and in Colorado, rich in silver and gold. An army recruited
in Texas and commanded by General Henry Sibley was sent to
accomplish Confederate aims.</p>
<p>This army entered New Mexico along the traditional route, moving up
the Rio Grande from El Paso. It quickly subdued the forts and Union
troops in southern New Mexico and continued up-river. On February 21,
1862, it met a Union army commanded by Colonel E. R. S. Canby at
Valverde, a small community about twenty miles south of Socorro, New
Mexico. Kit Carson, New Mexico&rsquo;s famous trapper and scout, commanded
the New Mexico Volunteers, a part of the Union force. Canby&rsquo;s troops were
beaten and dispersed at the Battle of Val Verde, leaving the upper Rio
Grande Valley virtually without defense. Within a few weeks, the Texans
had taken Albuquerque and Santa Fe. But one stronghold in New Mexico
remained in the hands of the Union forces. Fort Union, northeast of Las
Vegas, New Mexico, became the focal point of action by both north and
south. Sibley, marching from Santa Fe, knew success depended on the fall
of Fort Union. The Union forces, equally aware of the importance of the
fort, hurriedly reinforced it with a number of volunteers from Colorado.</p>
<p>Within Fort Union, a crisis developed over differing opinions on
strategy. The fort commander wanted to keep the garrison at full strength
and fight the Confederates from within the fort. The Colorado Volunteers
wanted to go out and meet the enemy. The latter won and a Union force
moved into the passes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to meet the
Confederates in a fateful battle that would decide control of the west.
It was fought at Glorieta Pass on March 28, 1862. Despite the fact that
the two armies met on this field, the contest was not decided there. Early
on the morning of March 28, a force of 400 Colorado Volunteers, commanded
by Colonel John M. Chivington, began a flanking action in hopes
of hitting the Confederate rear. This group moved out of the Pass into the
mountains, and by a very difficult route moved back toward the Pass behind
the Confederate force. On a ridge overlooking Apache Canyon, they saw
below them the entire Confederate supply train and cavalry horse herd.
In a lightning hit-and-run attack, the supply train and horses were destroyed.
When word of this reached Sibley at Glorieta Pass, there was
little for him to do but to retire from the field. The Confederate force
never recovered from this disaster and gradually retreated to Santa Fe, then
back down the Rio Grande into Texas.</p>
<p>With the end of the Civil War, New Mexico and the Southwest returned,
not to peace, but to war, war against the Apache. It took twenty
years for the American with all his modern weapons and tactics to bring
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
the Apache under control. For the Apache, it ended on September 3,
1886, when Geronimo and his few ragged followers surrendered to General
Miles in Skeleton Canyon, Arizona. Under the weight of steel and increasing
numbers of white men, the Apache was doomed. Though civilization
would swallow the Apache, as it has always succeeded against the barbarian,
the Apache made a spectacular defense of his lands and his way
of life against both Spaniard and American. He made himself master of
the desert, and only the gods of science succeeded in overcoming him
and his desert gods.</p>
<h3>INDUSTRIAL BOOM</h3>
<p>With the Indian situation settled, New Mexico underwent a boom in
two important areas, mining and cattle raising. These industries, so much
a part of the history of the American West, did and still play an important
role in the well-being of the Southwest. Mining camps sprang up along
the mountain fringes as new discoveries of silver and gold came to light.
Around Socorro and Magdalena, in the Mogollon Mountains, at Hillsboro
and Kingston in the Black Range, and hundreds of other places in
New Mexico and the Southwest, men hungry for quick wealth swarmed
over the hills and mountains and built their roaring camps. While miners
were tapping the subsurface wealth, cattlemen were staking out their
claims to the grasslands, both on the eastern plains and in the high mountain
meadows. Cattle empires grew to staggering proportions, sometimes
erupting into violent conflict over grazing and water rights, such as the
Lincoln County War made famous by the participation of Billy the Kid.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="344" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Feature of the Old West</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The character of the Southwest still bears the stamp of the miner and
the cattleman. Although the cattle and grazing industry has declined, as
has the traditional mining camp, the past importance of these activities
has had a tremendous impact upon the character of Southwest folklore,
law, and music and on the thought of the people.</p>
<p>Other influences affected New Mexico as a result of the American
occupation, things inherent in the American culture. Ribbons of steel
across a continent, buildings of steel and stone, business and commerce,
technology, common law, the English language, the Protestant religion,
and, above all, the American-brought driving desire to dominate, to win.
Certainly the American had to adapt his culture to the desert lands, but
he did it in his own way, not in the way of the Indian or Spaniard. So
Anglo-American culture became superimposed upon a Spanish culture
that was superimposed upon an Indian culture.</p>
<p><i>Disinherited</i>, that is the word that best describes contemporary New
Mexico culture. A stronger race came and took away the inheritance of
the Indian, though there did result a blood mixture. Only in superficial
matters did the Spanish adopt any of the Indian ways. The Spanish, too,
succumbed to a stronger people and have been denied the privilege commonly
accorded to conquered peoples, that of mixing their blood with
that of the conquerors. One finds today in New Mexico three distinct
people&mdash;Indian, Spanish, and Anglo-American&mdash;as sharply contrasted as
the strands in a Navajo blanket. There is pure red alongside white, and
only rarely do the colors blend into pinks or grays. This is why we must say
that New Mexico is a mosaic, not a synthesis, of many elements, clearly
defined.</p>
<p>Across the span of time, great men, people, and ideas have molded
New Mexico and Southwest history. Indian, Spanish, American&mdash;vital
forces that are today working toward a genuinely unique culture in New
Mexico. The modern world may well give to the Southwest the idea
or catalyst that will blend these elements into a single force. Science,
techniques, ideas are things of the present and are for the present to assess
and synthesize. The Indian gods of air, earth, and sky and the white
man&rsquo;s gods of morality and science do not differ a great deal in their aspirations
for their chosen people, and perhaps they will decree a splendid
and unique synthesis from the cultural mosaic. Through understanding
comes knowledge; from knowledge, creation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">The Exotic Plants of New Mexico</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">Ross Calvin</span></p>
<p>The problem of discussing plant life becomes complicated, for some
of those arriving in New Mexico may be compound microscope botanists,
some collectors, others pathologists, still others geneticists. Some will be
chemists or mathematicians, some others untrained in the ways of growing
things and mainly interested in seeing while they tour. But one thing is
fairly certain&mdash;most visitors will come from a distance, so it may be useful
to invite them to observe what they can readily see on the way hither,
which will be a relatively painless method of amassing some information.</p>
<p>Yet the method of arrival itself suggests choices, options, and exercises
in probability. Do visitors come in covered wagons, or in jet planes; by bus,
car, train, or some other way? The most convenient way, doubtless, is by
plane traveling six hundred miles an hour at a height of some thirty
thousand feet; but the most rewarding way is by saddle or on foot as the
early collectors came.</p>
<p>Since one cannot know his own country well if he knows no other, a
visitor from the east arriving at an altitude of five miles will probably be
more conscious than others of drastic changes in the landscape when he
first looks down on New Mexico. Instead of the universal green of the
east, he will note the earth as an unaccustomed tawny, reddish brown expanse,
and this will be its common color through most months of the year.
He will note the absence of rivers, but the presence of mountains which
generally ring the horizon. He will wonder, after traversing the border
counties at the western edge of the Great Plains, at the infrequency of
plowlands, and will promptly conclude that New Mexico is one vast, bare
desert&mdash;an impression that will be corrected rapidly when he visits the dark
National Forests where the slim, crowded spruces and firs tower skyward.</p>
<p>The visitor from El Paso, as the Chihuahua desert (the name is fairly
deserved) slides backward underneath him, will be amazed at the serpentine
stripe of vivid verdure below, all completely leveled, and all marked off by
geometrical lines and tightly bordered by pale hills where the vegetation
is reduced to tiny dots not tall enough to cast a shadow. Still proceeding
north, he will presently be above a ninety-mile stretch where the vegetation
is so skimpy and the river so closely boxed in by desolate hills that
Spanish explorers bestowed on it the sinister name <i>Jornada del Muerto</i>&mdash;Dead
Man&rsquo;s Journey, which is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, a visitor descending into New Mexico from the
northland in wintertime above this same Rio Grande will traverse a featureless
jumble of peaks on which the black coniferous forest no longer
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
shows as black at all but, snow-encased, gleams as white as the naked snowfields
themselves. And he will find incredible the immense range of climate
spanned in a flight only an hour long.</p>
<p>The jet traveler approaching from the west beholds the greatest,
most spectacular panorama of all, the true wasteland of the desert, with
vast blocks uplifted from out of earth&rsquo;s crust, plateaus dissected by giant
empty canyons whose walls are seared to utter nudity by ages of the most
intense sunshine on our continent. Here the architecture of nature is all
designed on a gigantic scale, and the climate exhibits influences of a mighty
ocean, of towering mountain chains, and the range of wandering planetary
winds which created the desert. From the altitude of a cruising jet, the
distances, the speed, the color, and the light are indescribably exhilarating.</p>
<p>Since the traveler arriving from any direction can see for identification
only a few species, it will suffice to point out only two of the harbingers of
eastern New Mexico, both of which are dominant on that area of the
Great Plains: the blue grama grass, which in fall and winter bears the
graceful sickle-shaped head, and the small <i>Yucca glauca</i> which cannot
be mistaken for anything else.</p>
<p>Along the northern line, the visitor should look for the somber, almost
black, forest of spruce and fir with its white patches of aspen on the 10,000-foot
slopes. Descending farther southward, even a casual observer will
note that these species give way first to the yellow pines, then to the
junipers (&ldquo;cedars&rdquo;) and dwarf pines or pi&ntilde;ons. The visitor arriving from
the south will find most conspicuous of all the olive-green creosote bush
in its summer-winter foliage, next, the omnipresent mesquite (<i>Prosopis</i>),
then the various <i>Opuntia</i> cacti (chollas and prickly pears), and the yuccas.</p>
<p>As he comes in from Arizona, the splendid saguaros will beckon him
toward the gateway of New Mexico, but they will nowhere enter it themselves.
The vase-shaped body of the ocotillo consisting of unbranching,
ten-foot wands should be recognized at a glance, as likewise should the
various yuccas and agaves. And in early springtime, a low tree with a
rounded mass of golden bloom will joyously proclaim its identity as a
paloverde.</p>
<p>The desert plants thus enumerated can be recognized along various
stretches of U.S. 66 as one holds his speed at a conservative ninety or,
even better, at a conservative sixty.</p>
<p>The amateur scientist will need to do some homework before he learns
much systematic botany or plant physiology. It takes considerable study
to comprehend the slow, age-long process which has resulted in the evolution
of all this grotesque vegetation: the interaction of extreme aridity,
high temperature, low humidity, high evaporation, infrequent precipitation,
the hostility of numerous chemical solutions, and the natural rapacity
of the animal population. Each plant must have an adaptation of its own,
from the tiny winter annual, which must race through its course from a
tender rosette to ripened seed before the searing sunshine arrives, on up
through the series to the stoic saguaro, which seems able to scorn nature&rsquo;s
enmity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>A final warning to the air traveler. He should be sure before deplaning
that he has observed a <i>bajada</i>. It is a must. Bajada is one name, outwash
slope is another, alluvial fan is still another. The stewardess should
inquire of each student, and if his answer is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; she should reply,
&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve just flunked the course.&rdquo; A bajada is the most characteristic
single feature of all in the sloping, stony topography of the desert&mdash;and
remember that the surface of the desert is regularly sloping and stony.
The Spanish word itself means only a down slope, but it has come to have
a semitechnical sense&mdash;a fan-shaped apron of rocky debris at the foot of
a mountain where it has settled out of the summer torrents and there
keeps accumulating in successive floods. As the mass builds up, the
bigger fragments drop out closest to the parent crag, then the small ones,
finally the coarse gravel, and lowest of all on the slope the fine sand.
Thus the fragments are graduated in size, in distance traveled, and in the
nature of soil resulting. As the fan increases in size and laps up higher and
higher on the mountain&rsquo;s flank, the geologists often describe the result
by saying that the mountain &ldquo;is burying itself under its own debris.&rdquo; From
the air, the lines of drainage will be seen to have assumed the form of a
tree with its trunk downward, its branches high in air. But the most
interesting aspect of a bajada is the nice proportion which nature works
out between the plant species and their location on the curve.</p>
<h3>FROM SAGEBRUSH TO SPRUCE TREES</h3>
<p>The traveler who has viewed the Southwestern panorama of nature
from its sagebrush to its spruce trees has indeed seen most of it. The spruce
which grows wild only well up on the higher mountains is familiar to
everybody because it has become a favorite in formal planting everywhere.
But the sages&mdash;who knows them? To the tenderfoot, almost any gray
plant is &ldquo;sage.&rdquo; To my friends the cowmen, sage means commonly saltbush.
To my friends the foresters, sage means an artemisia. But there are
romantics to whom &ldquo;purple sage&rdquo; is Apache plume, which is a member of
the wild rose family.</p>
<p>Some popular education would seem to be desirable. And this applies,
too, to the cacti, for there is more misinformation about them than anything
else that grows, runs, or creeps&mdash;except rattlesnakes. The clever
people who design travel folders and pictorial maps almost always put
saguaros in New Mexico. But saguaros do not grow in New Mexico. That
is final! And the yucca is not a cactus. That also is final. Nor yet the
ocotillo&mdash;that defiant, splendid denizen of the desert which flaunts the
scarlet torch of flowers. The question that is always on the surface as one
writes of plant life in the Southwest is, &ldquo;Who wants to know?&rdquo; The
picnicker wants to know the names&mdash;and nothing much besides&mdash;of the
wild flowers. My friend the cowman already has the names; that is, the
common ones. If I chance to mention blue grama grass, he gently corrects
me, &ldquo;black grama.&rdquo; Then if I mention black grama, he says, &ldquo;no, white
grama.&rdquo; But at least he is concerned about something more important than
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
nonscientific names. He wants to know if the plant is something that a
lean old cow can eat, whether it stays green in winter, and if it will hold
the soil in place. The tourist who pilots car and passengers some six hundred
miles between breakfast and bedtime asks only what he was looking
at. The rest of us who go into the mountains often enough to be impressed
by the layer-cake succession of plants on their slopes can, with the aid of
some reading, amass a store of knowledge where others amass only mileage.
On a tour, it is mileage or knowledge. One has to choose.</p>
<p>Actually, our New Mexico desert is not dominated by sage. That honor
is held by the creosote bush, called by some of the old-timers <i>greasewood</i>,
<i>Covillea glutinosa</i>, by some of the scientists&mdash;along with five other
synonyms. Like the mesquite with which it shares the same general habitat
but <i>does not intermix</i>, it occupies an immense spread of territory, roughly
from Texas to California. Since no livestock will eat it and the ground
it occupies is equally useless for agriculture because of aridity and stoniness,
creosote is a veritable coyote for survival. The traveler descending
from Taos to Santa Fe need not look for it. The sage of that locality,
which gives the landscape its singularly mournful aspect, is a true sage.
With good reason the cowboys call it <i>black sage</i>.</p>
<p>In 1846, Lieutenant Emory, as he rode southward with the Army of
the West, first encountered the creosote as he approached Socorro. The
northward extension of the plant is at the same point today, and the range
of mesquite extends only a few miles farther north. These two remarkable
plants are the main markers of the Lower Sonoran Zone. In the same
arid, stony, broken country, the traveler will find an abundance of cacti,
and these plants are usually supposed to be the most tenacious of all
tenacious growing things. Actually, in southwestern Arizona and neighboring
parts of California there are whole areas where the aridity is too severe
for cacti, but for our state&mdash;let it stand. Everybody, of course, has noted
the grotesque shape of the plants, but not everybody has noted that the
shape was chosen with a canny intelligence. A globe exposes less surface
(that is, the vulnerable area for evaporation) than any other solid of equal
volume. And a cylinder is second best. Another thing&mdash;cacti being succulents
are filled with a watery sap or juice which quickly coagulates after
a wound and stops the waste of moisture. Furthermore, the plant&rsquo;s aggressive
root system is arranged so as to capture the grounds scanty moisture
most quickly and completely after rains.</p>
<p>Cacti of more than sixty species occur within our state, but more than
nine tenths of the plants seen along the highway&mdash;unless they are brought
together for a garden collection&mdash;can be grouped into one genus, the
<i>Opuntia</i>. The family likeness is shown not by the shape or general appearance
but by the fact that all are jointed. Both the cane cactus (also
called cholla and elkhorn) and the pancaked prickly pear, unlike the big
barrel cactus and the numerous small species which resemble it in shape,
have joints and may therefore be rightly called opuntias. The &ldquo;pancakes,&rdquo;
it may be remarked, are not leaves but divisions of the stem. A cactus
gets along without leaves. So a good rough-and-ready test is this: if it has
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
leaves, it is not a cactus&mdash;which eliminates ocotillo, yucca, agave, sotol,
and so on.</p>
<p>The barrel cactus is sure to be seen growing beside service stations in
the southern part of the state. Its name as well as its size identifies it. The
flowers and the large lemon-shaped fruits are worth a glance. If they do
not occur on the south side of the plant, it has been transplanted and
turned. The evidence is as trustworthy as the presence of moss on the north
side of a tree in the forest.</p>
<p>The barrel cacti, the opuntias, acacias, the ocotillos, along with the
creosote and mesquite already mentioned, have a way of growing along
together in what is called a plant society. These all belong in the bottom
layer of the cake called the Lower Sonoran Zone, which is best seen on
the Rio Grande mesas near El Paso.</p>
<p>The layer next above it comprises the foothill country of the Upper
Sonoran Zone, which includes most of the state of New Mexico. Some of
its common markers are juniper, pi&ntilde;on, oak of various species including
live oak, mountain mahogany, mescal, yucca, beargrass, and the famous
blue grama grass. It is exhibited all along the Continental Divide in the
southwest part of the state but nowhere so well as in the Fort Bayard
Reservation. There a tract, protected for three generations from woodcutting,
fires, and intensive grazing, offers a large-scale picture of the lovely
land that once was New Mexico. There the character and amount of
vegetation astounds the visitor who is familiar with only the close-picked,
parched aspect of the landscape that generally borders the main highways.
When seen from the air, the very color of the grass-mantled earth is many
shades lighter than that of the bare overgrazed ranges a few miles to the
south. And the difference can be seen by anybody.</p>
<p>The foothills are dotted, not covered, with juniper and pi&ntilde;on. The
dwarfed, rounded little junipers (properly enough called cedars) leave
the traveler unprepared to believe that they will anywhere become respectable
forest trees. Yet in the Burro Mountains, the alligator-bark species,
finest of them all, reaches a diameter of five feet and an age of about
1000 years. The wood has an extraordinary fragrance, and its smoke tells
the neighbors for blocks around that you are warming yourself at the fireplace.
Another notable thing about the wood is its resistance to decay
in the earth. I have removed pieces of it from subterranean ruins of the
Mimbres culture which, according to the best archaeological opinion, are
some eight hundred years old.</p>
<p>The yuccas deserve a story by themselves. One small, unimpressive
species greets you on the meadows at the foot of Raton Pass; others have
to be searched out along high limestone ridges where the foothills are
deciding to become mountains. The one chosen for our state flower is the
tall yucca (<i>Yucca elata</i>), a superb species best seen along the Continental
Divide near Silver City. The genus reaches its greatest size in the grotesque
Joshua tree, which never fails to attract the eye on the Mohave desert in
California.</p>
<p>The century plant has a name that always gets attention. But let us
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
be sure we mean the same thing. Rightly,
it means the mescal, the favorite food of
the Mescalero Apaches. Besides these two
names, it is called also maguey and, no
doubt, Spanish dagger along with various
other spine-tipped plants. All of which
clinches the argument for a name which
for all users is a certain designation for one
object and only one. It is not just because
botanists like to appear learned that they
call this plant <i>Agave parryi</i>. That title is
as descriptive as middle C for one key on
the piano, and in the same way international.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="596" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Yucca plants</span></p>
</div>
<p>Everyone inquires about the century
plant&rsquo;s life expectancy. An insurance man
might make an inference from the name.
The plant is a big compact cluster or rosette
of rigid, upward-pointing, spadelike
leaves, each four or five inches in width
and each tipped with a vicious, stout thorn.
Year after year the plant just sits there by
a boulder, unnoticed. I question whether
anything alive on the desert has a better
life expectancy. As far as my observations go, it has no diseases. It is invincible
to drouth. Freezing does not harm it, and fire cannot burn it&mdash;although
a yucca even when green will flame up like a torch. No hungry
old cow can crop it, and no rodent gnaws it, at least not enough to do
harm. And since the Indians have gone on reservations, no human uses
it. So it stays there.</p>
<p>In fact, nothing less than a caterpillar can leave a dent on it&mdash;not, of
course, the caterpillar that eats young tomato plants, but the Caterpillar
that pulls heavy road machinery. The plant just does not die before
maturity, it would seem. A remarkable organism, indeed! But after many,
many years, depending on the amount of moisture it receives, it makes up
its mind to flower. In one tremendous effort, it shoots up a twelve-foot flower
stalk at the rate of several inches a day. The blossoming is a final, dramatic,
beautiful gesture, for by the time the flowers have withered, the
great tenacious plant has turned to a ghastly purple and is dead.</p>
<p>On the high slopes where the last yuccas end and only a few junipers
remain in the race for survival, the yellow pines come in to mark off what
is called the Transition Zone. The pines need no description, no printed
promotion. The traveler, any traveler, can appreciate them although
he might not be stirred to the slightest interest by the lovely yuccas. Since
the beginning of time, the pines, fragrant, cheerful, companionable, have
been man&rsquo;s best friend. Among the ponderosa pines takes place most of the
hunting, most of the camping, much of the picnicking. There is no
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
danger that the tourist will overlook the pine belt and the pines for they
are probably the most numerous tree in New Mexico.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">

</div>
<p>Above them, the classifications are less clearly defined and ecologists are
less inclined to agree on zonation. The Canadian Zone, if we settle on that
name, occurs only in small areas on the map, and most of them north of
Santa Fe. These are high ridges and island peaks that tower high enough
to tempt the Engelmann spruces. Yet some of these islands occur as far
south as the Mogollon Mountains and thus bring Canadian Zone scenes
almost to the Mexican border. For hardy ecologists who want to explore
high ridges and horns of bare stone which rise as clean as a hound&rsquo;s tooth
clear up into the Arctic-alpine Zone, it is necessary to enter Colorado.</p>
<p>Engelmann spruce forests may be associated with the 10,000-foot level.
The blue spruce is very similar, perhaps only a subspecies, but it comes
in a little lower. The Engelmann makes a dense forest hardly allowing
invaders, but the blue is more tolerant, less austere. It loves the water and is
the natural companion of chill, cascading trout streams. Though fond of
shadow, it seems to grow equally well where the narrow canyons widen
and admit the sunshine upon the tiny meadows of lush grass, cranesbill,
velvety red cinquefoils, lupines, and yellow columbines. And when one of
these miniature openings is fringed with spruces whose pointed tips rise
sharp against a curtain of azure with its white cumulus clouds, there you
have the loveliest vista in the mountains.</p>
<h3>OUR VISIBLE IMPACT ON THE PLANT LIFE</h3>
<p>Though nature lovers usually find the life zones more fascinating than
any other aspect of plants in the mountains, there is one other much more
important. It is the misuse, injury, and destruction of native plant life.
Because scientists are generally alert to the conservation of what is useful
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
and beautiful in natural resources, I venture to bring up the matter
here.</p>
<p>A useful case history is provided by Silver City, New Mexico. It was
founded in the early seventies as a silver camp, which would fairly guarantee
a certain amount of reckless haste and rowdy carelessness. Point two
was its location on a foothill watershed only twenty-seven square miles in
area. Point three was an extreme concentration of livestock near the town.
Point four was the fact that the annual rainfall was crowded mainly into
July, August, and a part of September.</p>
<p>Mines are naturally users of timber. Obviously, shafts and tunnels
have to be timbered. More than that, little smelters nestled back among
the hills were also hungry for wood. And since coal was expensive and
hard to get, most of the adobe cottages were heated many years by juniper,
oak, and pi&ntilde;on firewood. All these matters were naturally, if not actually,
inevitable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>The massive ore wagons and freight wagons had to be drawn by
four- to ten-horse teams&mdash;and the horses kept on eating. Then because it was
also a ranching country, each cowboy had to keep a <i>remuda</i> of saddle
horses&mdash;and they ate too. Also, the few cows that provided milk for the
children grazed hungrily over the stony slopes. Most of all, the range
cattle, which had no provender at all except that which the competitive,
half-starved steers could provide for themselves, overgrazed every square
foot of pasturage down to the bare soil. The government&rsquo;s open-range
policy made overgrazing inevitable because no ranchman could protect
his pasturage since it was all unfenced. The cow that got there first got
the grass. That passed as land management, which proves that some statesmen
then were about as wise as some of the Wizards of Washington now.
But the advent of fences caused the cutting of millions of fence posts
where none should have been cut.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p08a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="377" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Elk</span></p>
</div>
<p>When the grass went, its roots went, and when its roots went, there
was nothing to hold the soil, and then it, too, started to go. And go it did.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
A deep hole formed in Main Street, as it is still called on the Silver City
town plat. The best explanation I can find of that hole is that earth was
taken out of it to form adobe bricks for the walls of houses and corrals (that
clay did make good adobe!). Meanwhile, the woodhaulers&rsquo; wagons had
greedily carted away the trees from each little canyon, while the narrow
steel tires cut deep ruts which formed two deep gullies at the first heavy
rain. Then the parallel gullies proceeded to wash out deeper and create
a middle ridge or high center on which axles got stuck. Since there was
nobody responsible for making a new road, there was no choice except to
move over and form another track and use it until in turn it became unusable.
(By this simple kind of destruction, the old Santa Fe Trail, it is
said, reached a width of a hundred feet.)</p>
<p>But the water descending the slope kept increasing its destructive
velocity as the denuded ground approached the bareness of a tin roof.
Villagers observed that the hole in their Main Street was becoming a waterfall
after each rain, and that the ruin was passing into a big-time operation.
The town built a dam to restrain the floods. It washed out in the
first one. Soon Main Street followed it down the drain, which by this
time was already a hideous gash in the earth many miles long and twenty
feet deep. Then the water began on a really different scale of destruction.
One furious flood washed away the cabin in which Billy the Kid&rsquo;s mother
lived. More than that, it washed away the wall of Judge Newcomb&rsquo;s house
and abducted his Steinway from the second floor. A few yards from the
spot, an old photograph taken in 1891 shows a woodhauler&rsquo;s ox team
lying in the street there. It gives no hint at that time of the famous Big
Ditch&mdash;the only name that Main Street, Silver City has had now for the
last forty years.</p>
<p>By 1927, after many other attempts had been made to tame the floods
a steel bridge about one hundred feet long and thirty feet above the floor
of the &ldquo;canyon&rdquo; was swung into place. In 1935-1936, the Soil Conservation
Service went to work in earnest, made the watershed a demonstration
area, and spent a third of a million dollars there in a short time.</p>
<p>In the <i>New Mexico Magazine</i> for August 1934, the really incredible
story of the Big Ditch is exactly documented with old photographs and
newspaper clippings. After a friendship of many years with old-time
miners and ranchers at Silver City, I would not point an accusing finger
at one of them. I appeal, however, for a greater vigilance over plant life
and soils nowadays from everybody. In such protected areas as the Fort
Bayard Reservation, the U.S. National Forest enclosures, and the frontier
cemeteries, the imagination can visualize a New Mexico that is far different
from what is here today&mdash;a close-picked, hard-used land where unwise
woodcutting has continued through much of the last three centuries and
where the thin ranges have been required to support in the last century
alone perhaps more than one hundred million cows, sheep, and horses.
The magnitude of the cause accounts for the magnitude of the effect.</p>
<p>A good many years ago, I wrote as the concluding paragraph to <i>Sky
Determines</i> what seemed to some exaggerated praise for my adopted homeland.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
There is now less and less cavil from any readers. I believed the words
true in 1934, and I stand my ground now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps nowhere in the world is the natural setting nobler than in
New Mexico&mdash;more beautiful with spacious desert, sky, mountain; more
varied in rich, energizing climate, more dramatic in its human procession,
more mellow with age-old charm. Endowed with sunshine that stimulates,
and winter chill that toughens; with silence and majestic desert color that
offer a spiritual companionship, it has enough. Here, if anywhere is air,
earth, sky fit to constitute a gracious homeland, not alone for those who
study and create, but as well for those who play, for those who sit still to
brood and dream.</p>

<p>The vast sweep of New Mexico&rsquo;s 77 million acres, which ranges all the
way from the Alpine tundra of the tallest mountains down to the heat
of the lower Sonoran desert, offers a home and sanctuary for many kinds
of wild life.</p>
<p>Some of these animals are considered game animals; others may be
pests, since they prey upon or destroy what mankind regards as its own.
The coyote which takes a sheep from the small herder is wicked indeed
in the eyes of the sheepman. Predatoriness on all living things by other
things has gone on since time began and will continue&mdash;mankind
being not the least predator.</p>
<p>A good definition is that composed by the late Judge C. M. Botts who
defined a predator as &ldquo;a critter that takes another critter that I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New Mexico&rsquo;s immense topographic and geologic differences make for
a very wide range of habitats preferred by the various species. The elk and
deer, being highly adaptable, may be found from the Alpine tundra of
the higher mountains clear out into the creosote desert. Deer occur in four
separate subspecies: the Rocky Mountain and the desert mule deer, the
western whitetail, and the Sonoran fantail deer, which is also a whitetail.
These animals may be found all the way from the dense coniferous forests
of the north with perpetual gloom and cold to the sun-scorched granite
mountains such as the Florida and the Organ mountains of southern
New Mexico; from great towering granite spires to the folded blocks of
limestone such as comprise the Big Hatchets, the Guadalupe, and the
San Andres mountains.</p>
<p>The javelina, or little wild pig, lives along the watercourses in the south
west part of the state. Its thin spiky hair gives it little or no protection
against cold, and only in the balmier parts of New Mexico does it feel at
home.</p>
<p>The desert bighorn sheep, as distinguished from his cousin the Rocky
Mountain bighorn, goes around on a sun-scorched, ocotillo-covered limestone-rubble
slope in the full glare of the sun and lies down to take his
afternoon siesta. The Rocky Mountain bighorn, on the other hand, with
his preference for cooler climates does not shun even the dense spruce
timber at the very top of the Sandia Mountains as the hideout for his
afternoon rest.</p>
<p>This adaptability by New Mexico&rsquo;s species to the tremendous differences
in altitude, rainfall, and temperature makes them all the more valuable
as a resource for the pleasure and enjoyment of everyone.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The most popular big game animals in New Mexico are the mule deer
in either of the two subspecies. Every fall, beginning in late October
and extending ordinarily through December, more than 100,000 hunters
take to the woods for their 50-50 chance of bringing home the sought-after
mule deer. A hunter may shoot his mule deer at the Alpine tundra
timber line, out in the blazing heat of the creosote desert, or among the
rock crags of some of the southern desert mountains. He will find his
quarry a worthy opponent. Shy, wild, and with terrific eyesight and hearing,
these animals provide a true challenge.</p>
<p>Elk and antelope, as well as bighorn sheep, are hunted by special
licenses only, since their numbers do not warrant a general open season.
These special licenses are much sought after and are ordinarily made
available by application and a public drawing in the fall. The javelina,
confined to our southwestern counties, is also hunted by special license. It
is noteworthy that although New Mexico had protected them for many
years, the javelina did not increase its numbers. As a matter of fact,
the natural losses applied against any game species are going to be in
effect no matter whether hunting is permitted or not, the hunting being
merely subtracted from what would be lost to nature anyhow.</p>
<p>Our state mammal, the black bear, is found throughout the wooded
areas of the state and occasionally wanders out into the plains or down into
the desert mountains of the south. Bears are hunted avidly in the fall by
sportsmen with dog packs before the regular big game seasons begin, when
the use of dogs is prohibited. They are again hunted during the big game
seasons by anyone bearing the proper license, but no packs of dogs are
allowed. This is to prohibit the possibility of dogs being used to pursue
elk, deer, or wild turkey, an illegal act in New Mexico.</p>
<p>New Mexico is fortunate in having a tremendous diversity of both
upland game and waterfowl, and big game and small game for her people.
Importantly, the game resources are spread out through every county in
the state.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s richness of bird life is varied and extensive. New Mexico
ranks among the first five in the total number of birds found within its
boundaries. More than 400 species of birds live within the state. These
range all the way from the tiny mites of the bird kingdom, the hummingbirds,
weighing less than an ounce, to the great white whistling swan,
weighing up to 25 pounds, or the Merriam turkey, which may weigh close
to 30. Of the six species of quail found in the United States, New Mexico
has four and may possess the fifth, since the mountain quail of the western
coast have been introduced into this state and still occur on the west slopes
of the Sacramento Mountains near Tularosa. Five species of doves found
throughout the state from the highest coniferous forest down into the
scorching heat of the creosote desert are the Inca dove, ground dove,
mourning dove, white-winged dove, and the bandtail pigeon, all of them
close relatives. Of these, only two, the mourning dove and the white-winged
dove, are commonly hunted as game species.</p>
<p>An unexplained and precipitous decline struck the bandtail pigeon
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
about ten or twelve years ago, from which it apparently has never recovered.
Although hunting was undoubtedly part of the pressure exercised
against these birds, it in no way accounted for their sudden and dramatic
decline in numbers. This decline may gradually be reversed, since more
and more of these birds are being seen. It is well known that animals with
a high reproductive capacity can endure much heavier losses to their population
than can those with low or very limited reproduction, such as the
bandtail, which normally lays only a single egg. The mourning dove, on
the other hand, lays two eggs at a time and may raise as many as five
or more broods in one year. Take this one step further with the scaled or
Gambel quail, which may lay up to 12 or 15 eggs, and it can readily be
seen that the population of bandtail pigeons can never endure the losses
that the much more prolific mourning dove and quail can. The same might
be said by comparison of elk and deer. Elk do not bear their first young
until their third year, and then the cow may not bear young but alternate
years until her seventh or eighth year; by that time she has begun to decline
in vigor; in her total life she may not produce more than four or
five calves. The mule deer, on the other hand, start bearing at the age
of two, with their first birth normally single; from then on, twins are
usual for the rest of the doe&rsquo;s life. Thus, deer have a considerably greater
reproductive potential than do elk or bighorn sheep, which have one
young at a time.</p>
<p>The fleet-footed antelope of the open rolling plains is another example
of fairly high reproductive capacity, since they breed earlier than do deer
and normally bear twins. Antelope are confined to the more open country
where their prodigious running ability and marvelous eyesight stand in
good stead in protecting them against their natural enemies.</p>
<p>The wild turkey, classified by law in New Mexico as big game, is
found throughout the mountainous areas of the state, not excepting some
of the desert ranges. New Mexico is one of two states fortunate enough
to possess three of the five forms of the wild turkey known to the United
States: the Merriam turkey, found in the higher elevations of the mountainous
areas, usually the ponderosa forest; the Rio Grande turkey, confined
to the watercourses of the eastern plains; and the fairly rare Mexican
turkey, found in the Animas and Peloncillo mountains of extreme southwestern
New Mexico. In Hildalgo County these mountains are actually
largely Mexican in both flora and fauna. Some of the rarest, most beautiful
birds of North America are also found in this area and nowhere else
in the United States with the exception of southeastern Arizona.</p>
<p>Our most abundant game bird, the mourning dove, is found in every
county of the state and nests from the coniferous forests of the north and
the higher mountains of the south clear out into the plains where there
is not a tree in sight for miles. Doves are extremely adaptable and very
prolific. They provide the finest kind of sport shooting and are avidly
sought, particularly by shotgun enthusiasts of the eastern and southern
parts of the state.</p>
<p>Scaled quail are found throughout New Mexico, being absent only
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
in elevations above 7000 feet. Even there, they periodically occur but are
ordinarily driven back by winter snow. Gambel quail are found throughout
the river courses of the Rio Grande Valley, the San Juan Valley, and
the southwestern watercourses. The Mearns&rsquo; quail is found in the southern
half of the state in the higher mountain elevations, whereas the bob-white
quail occupies the grassy rolling sandhills of the eastern counties
where it is commonly found together with scaled quail.</p>
<p>Quail hunting is one of the most popular sports in New Mexico and
many thousands of hunters can hardly wait from one season to the next.
New Mexico is in the heart of the scaled quail country and provides some
of the finest shooting to be had anywhere.</p>
<p>Migratory waterfowl, while not considered abundant, are not uncommon
in this state, known more for its aridity than for its rivers and lakes.
The two main fly ways are the Rio Grande Valley and the Pecos Valley,
with the Pecos Valley being somewhat ahead in total numbers.</p>
<p>Ducks commonly found in New Mexico in abundance are teal, both
green-winged and blue-winged as well as the lesser-known cinnamon teal,
mallards, widgeon, pintails, gadwall, scaups, canvasbacks, redheads, and
other species.</p>
<p>In addition, New Mexico plays winter home to many thousands of the
lesser sandhill crane which is confined to the river valleys and open plains
of the eastern part of the state, particularly the southeastern counties. A
smaller population of the greater sandhill crane is found in the Rio Grande
Valley and near Columbus. Flocks of the small Richardson&rsquo;s goose are
found in the northeastern counties, in particular, and along river courses
throughout the state. The small snow goose is likewise confined mostly
to major river courses. The larger Canada geese are found particularly in
the middle Rio Grande Valley where extensive development has been
made by both state and federal agencies to encourage the use and the
presence of bands of geese.</p>
<p>New Mexico is unique in that it was the first state in many years to be
able to open a hunting season on the lesser sandhill crane. This bird is
comparatively abundant, the total population probably being in excess of
200,000, with the vast majority of these birds wintering in west Texas,
New Mexico, and Mexico. They occasionally cause heavy depredation to
grain crops in the southeastern part of the state, and hunting has been
partly justified on the basis that the large wintering flocks might be broken
up and depredation spread over a larger area for less individual effect.
These birds are tall, wild, and shy. They are hard to hunt, even more so
than geese, and although strenuous efforts have been made, not too many
of them are bagged.</p>
<p>One should not overlook the tremendous opportunity for sport hunting
of unprotected species, such as the various rabbits, the mountain lions
and bobcats, and coyotes.</p>
<p>The wolf is now very rare in New Mexico. Only occasionally do wolves
come out of Mexico into the southwestern counties, usually in Hidalgo,
Luna, and Do&ntilde;a Ana. Wolves are large, effective predators and are incompatible
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
with the cattle-raising industry. Since they have a fondness for
beef, the hand of the cattleman is raised against them.</p>
<p>The mountain lion prefers his natural prey of deer, mule deer being the
principal victims. The bobcat preys on deer and on many of the small
wild animals, rabbits in particular. These predators, when run and hunted
with a pack of dogs, provide a fascinating sport which is growing in
popularity.</p>
<p>The use of calls to attract animals to a &ldquo;victim&rdquo; has become widespread.
The calls imitate the distressed cry of rabbits and other creatures which to
the predator means a meal close at hand. Everything from mountain lions
to red-tailed hawks have been hunted by this procedure, and it can be
very successful in bagging quarry. This type of hunting has value in that
it can be enjoyed at any time of the year throughout the state and with a
minimum of time and effort.</p>
<p>Hunting is a conservation practice that, wisely administered, results
in wholesome out-of-door recreation and brings many tons of high protein
food of highest quality to the table. Nature nowhere in her economy
locks up a resource and throws away the key&mdash;we should be no less wise.</p>
<p>Long gone are the buffalo which once roamed the High Plains of
eastern New Mexico. Exotic animals, imported and stocked along the
rugged canyon of the Canadian River above Conchas Reservoir, are the
Barbary sheep with their magnificent coiled horns. Beavers dam some of
the mountain streams, badgers and skunks can be seen from the highways,
and amid the forests are squirrels and porcupines, while high on rock
slopes, the Rocky Mountain woodchuck and the gray rock cony dash from
ledge to ledge. The white-tailed ptarmigan also haunts these high crags,
and lower down the mountain, bluebirds nest. Hawks, eagles, magpies,
jays, ravens, orioles, wrens, sparrows, warblers, finches, and many other
birds of endless variety soar over canyon, forest, and sand-dune desert.</p>
<p>Most notable of all is the crested roadrunner, the chapparal cock or
paisano of Mexico and the state bird. In between racing with horsemen
or automobiles, the slender roadrunner cocks his head, strikes swiftly and
victoriously, then swallows his victim, which can be a small rattlesnake,
whole.</p>
<p>Snakes there are aplenty. Mostly, they are nonpoisonous, such as the
garter snake, glass snake, puff adder, ring-necked snake, the coachwhip,
the Mexican blacksnake, and the large western bullsnake. The small but
very venomous coral snake is rare, but common among rocks and near
streams are the large western diamondback rattlesnake, the prairie rattlers,
and the less common green or blacktailed rattlesnake. Every sun-warmed
rock has its scampering lizard, and nearby are horned toads, dry-land terrapins,
tortoises, tarantulas, centipedes, vinegarroons, scorpions, and spiders.
Of these latter desert animals, only the black widow spider is poisonous.</p>
<p>Contrast in the influence of environments is shown by the animals that
inhabit the &ldquo;malpais,&rdquo; the recent flows of black, rough-surfaced lava, compared
with similar animals found among the white gypsum dunes of
White Sands. Black or darkly colored subspecies of mice, plains wood rats,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
kangaroo rats, and rock squirrels live on the black lava, whereas white or
pale counterparts of these animals live among the white gypsum dunes.</p>

<p>The dwellers in the hills and plains of New Mexico are as varied as the
hills and plains; they add their color and movement to the scenes of the
Land of Enchantment.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Rocks That Shape the Enchanting Landscape</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">Frank E. Kottlowski</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;As old as the hills.&rdquo; How much more ancient can anything be? Yet
New Mexico&rsquo;s hills, its enchanting landscapes, were built in but the most
recent &ldquo;minute&rdquo; of geologic time. Merely one geologic era ago, marine
waters covered the state, and storm-tossed waves ruled where now the hot
sun beats down on dry sands and cacti a mile above sea level.</p>
<p>What determined the Land of Enchantment&rsquo;s landscapes? Shaping
these land forms are the rocks of the earth&rsquo;s crust, the structure of those
rocks, and the endless battle between the rocks and the atmosphere. A
story spelled out in stone, the geologic history. The rocks determine.</p>
<p>Eons ago, it began; one billion, two billion, or perhaps even more
billions of years ago. A history whose beginnings have been lost owing to
destruction of its earliest records. A history, written in the rocks, that is
divided into four general parts (<a href="#fig12">fig. 1</a>). The oldest rocks, more than 600
m.y. (million years) old, almost devoid of traces of life, are the Precambrian
rocks. The Paleozoic rocks, 230 to 600 m.y. old, are marked by ancient
(<i>paleo</i>-) life. This was the Period of Invertebrates, animals without backbones.
Mesozoic rocks, 70 to 230 m.y. old, formed in the Era of Dinosaurs
and contain types of life that are intermediate (<i>meso</i>-) between the ancient
and modern animals. And rocks of the Cenozoic Era, 70 m.y. ago to the
present, make up the latest (<i>ceno</i>-, recent) chapter of the earth&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Events of the Cenozoic Era have had the greatest influence on New
Mexico&rsquo;s landscapes. So let us begin the story at the dawn of the Cenozoic,
and return to the earlier geologic chapters later.</p>
<h3>CENOZOIC ERA</h3>
<p>The mountains, the plains, the rivers, and the lakes all are transitory
features of the landscape, created during the recent part of the Cenozoic
Era, and all doomed to destruction in the near future, geologically speaking.
Even so, some of the plains and mountains may predate man&rsquo;s evolution
onto the earth scene.</p>
<p>Gone were the late Mesozoic seas; never again during our lifetime nor
the lifetime of many future generations will marine waters roll over New
Mexico, and sea-spawned creatures rule. For the first two thirds of the
Cenozoic, the Paleogene Period (25 to 70 m.y. ago), New Mexico suffered
from the dying effects of the great Laramide upheaval of the earth&rsquo;s crust.
Large areas were exposed to the harsh erosion of stream and wind. The
landscape looked as parts of southwestern New Mexico do today&mdash;tall
rugged mountain ranges scattered in isolated patches amid wide gravelly
plains. But the climate was more humid, and while no large through rivers
are known, local great swamps and lakes lay on the plains in debris-trapping
lowlands.</p>

</div>
<p>Scenery in north-central New Mexico (<a href="#fig13">fig. 2</a>) may have been similar
to today&rsquo;s, with mountains in the same general areas as the present-day
Sangre de Cristo, Nacimiento, San Juan, and Brazos ranges. Coarse-grained
gravels were stacked up at the edges of the mountains, but out in
the adjoining lowlands, floodplain sands and varicolored lake-bed clays
settled. Three low areas were &ldquo;basins&rdquo; of deposition where thick masses of
sediments accumulated&mdash;the Raton and Poison Canyon formations in the
Raton Basin near Raton, the Animas, Nacimiento, and San Jose formations
in the San Juan Basin north and northwest of Cuba, seen along
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
N.M. Highway 44, with thinner deposits of the El Rito and Blanco Basin
formations to the northeast of Cuba, and the Galisteo Formation in the
Galisteo Basin south and southwest of Santa Fe. Volcanic rocks, the Espinaso
beds, overlie the Galisteo but are not much younger in age. Reddish
rocks of the Galisteo Formation crop out along U.S. Highway 85 at La
Bajada Hill about twenty miles southwest of Santa Fe. The Sandia
Mountains&rsquo; area appears to have been a lowland.</p>
<p>Silicified wood, chiefly of pines but with some oak and poplar, is
abundant in the Galisteo Formation. Large logs, up to 6 feet in diameter
and 135 feet long, have been found. In the great swamps of the Raton
Basin, where the climate was much like that of Georgia today, tall reeds,
water lilies, fig trees, palm trees, magnolias, and sycamores grew in profusion,
and contributed to the thick coal beds now mined there. The early
ages of the Cenozoic saw the spectacular rise of the mammals to dominance
over reptiles on land; numerous remains of the early mammals are found
in the Nacimiento and San Jose formations, including the famous Puerco
and Torrejon faunas&mdash;as well as many clams, snails, fish, turtles, crocodiles,
snakes, and birds.</p>
<p>Southeastern New Mexico appears to have been relatively level with
only local hills and vast regions of featureless, stagnant but high plains
where erosion slowly ate downward, deposition was slight, and most of the
detritus was carried eastward far beyond the state&rsquo;s borders. The redbeds
of the Baca Formation were laid down on the north flank of low mountains
that extended intermittently from somewhere near Quemado toward
Socorro. Some ancient hills near present-day Sierra Blanca shed rock fragments
that accumulated near Capitan as the varicolored Cub Mountain
Formation. Deeply eroded uplands northwest of Elephant Butte Reservoir
supplied gravels and sands that mingled with andesitic volcanic debris
as the upper part of the McRae Formation in central Sierra County. Many
of the weathered greenish and purplish volcanic rocks in southwestern
New Mexico were extruded at this time, and beneath the surface these
molten magmas (hot liquefied rocks) cut into older rocks. Vapors and hot
solutions from the magmas are believed to have emplaced some of New
Mexico&rsquo;s vast ore deposits during this time.</p>
<p>The last phase of the Paleogene Period, about 25 to 40 m.y. ago, was
an earth-shaking time in New Mexico&mdash;and the first explosion of an
atomic bomb in 1945 on the Jornada del Muerto between Socorro and
Carrizozo was a relatively low-energy-yield event compared with the late
Paleogene earth movements. Almost the entire southwestern quarter of
the state literally exploded, with volcanic eruptions on a grand scale.
These lava flows, rock breccias, ashes, pumice, and associated intrusives
(molten rocks that did not make it to the surface) form the Datil-Mogollon
plateau&mdash;at least 100 miles in diameter&mdash;as part of the Datil Formation,
which locally is miles thick, and made up the main mass of many other
ranges near the Mexican border. Sierra Blanca (12,003 feet altitude)
northeast of Alamogordo is a huge, isolated volcanic mass of late Paleogene
age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>

<p class="pcap">Figure 3. <span class="sc">East-west cross section of Rio Grande graben near Santa Fe</span></p>
</div>
<p>This widespread volcanic activity continued into the Neogene Period
which began about 25 m.y. ago. Rhyolites, pumice, and perlite in the
southwest, as well as in other parts of the state, covered wide areas. Mount
Taylor, towering up to 11,389 feet near Grants and visible on the western
skyline from Albuquerque, is a Neogene volcanic pile, as are parts of the
Sangre de Cristo range northeast of Taos. Shiprock and Cabezon Peak,
landmarks in northwestern New Mexico, are volcanic necks&mdash;the eroded
cores of ancient volcanoes.</p>
<p>Valle Grande caldera makes up the center of the Jemez Mountains
west of Los Alamos and is a late Neogene volcanic mass with the central
crater sixteen miles in diameter&mdash;one of the world&rsquo;s largest calderas. Bandelier
National Monument headquarters is within a canyon carved from
Valle Grande&rsquo;s ashes. Volcanic ash scattered over the western parts of
Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas was blown from this volcano. Capulin
Mountain, east of Raton, is a huge recent cinder cone and is surrounded
by numerous basaltic lava flows that cap the High Plains from Raton
eastward to Clayton. The very fresh black basalt flows near Carrizozo and
in the valley of Rio San Jose near Grants are probably less than 1000
years old. Numerous mesas along the Rio Grande Valley from the Colorado
line to El Paso are capped by black basalt flows of late Neogene age.</p>
<p>Many of the present-day mountains were uplifted in early Neogene
time, following the climax of the great volcanic eruptions. This uplifting,
in many instances, took place along one side of huge mountain masses,
forming tilted fault blocks like the Sandia, Manzano, San Andres, and
Sacramento mountains. Rock beds in the Sandia Mountains, for example,
dip to the east, but were uplifted along a west-bounding fault
zone&mdash;a huge break in the earth&rsquo;s crust&mdash;as much as four miles! This was an earth-shaking
event! However, the uplifting took place slowly, and indeed is continuing
today as the Albuquerque area, along with the Rio Grande Valley
southward to Socorro, is one of the most active earthquake areas in the
state.</p>
<p>Concurrent with uplift, other blocks of the earth&rsquo;s crust sank, forming
graben basins which were flooded with rock debris from the adjoining
uplifts. A tremendous irregular graben, now followed by the Rio
Grande, cut north-south across the state. Geologists label it the <i>Rio Grande
structural depression</i> (<a href="#fig14">fig. 3</a>). Mountains on the east are the Sangre de
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Cristo, Sandia, Manzano, Los Pinos, Fra Cristobal, and Caballo ranges;
those to the west include the Brazos, Jemez, Ladron, Socorro, Magdalena,
and San Mateo mountains. Within this complex graben, and around the
bordering ranges, the colorful sandstones and siltstones of the Santa Fe
Group were deposited&mdash;these red, yellow, orange, and cream rocks are
eroded in many places, such as near Santa Fe, to &ldquo;badlands&rdquo; characteristic
of the landscapes along the Rio Grande Valley from Espanola southward
to El Paso. Much brightly tinted silicified wood is found in these beds,
and literally freight-car loads of mammalian remains have been shipped
to museums from outcrops near Espanola.</p>
<p>In the basins amid the mountains of southwestern New Mexico,
similar sands and gravels of the Gila Conglomerate filled low areas. East
of the mountains of central New Mexico that form a north-south chain
of ranges from Raton to Carlsbad, thin gravels of the Ogallala Formation
were dumped onto the western edges of the High Plains. They now cap
the plains as well as make picturesque bluffs east of the Pecos River
and southeast of Tucumcari&mdash;the &ldquo;caprock&rdquo; of that area. In northwestern
New Mexico, isolated mesas are topped by the Chuska and Bidahochi formations;
similar sands, silts, and clays washed from adjoining highlands.</p>
<p>The final episodes of landscape formation occurred during the Pleistocene
Epoch, the recent glacial period. Mountain valley glaciers occupied
some of the higher parts of the state, as far southward as Sierra Blanca;
large lakes filled many of the closed basins, such as those near Estancia
and south of Lordsburg; the Carrizozo and Grants basalt flows were extruded;
the final tremendous explosions of Valle Grande spread volcanic
ash over large regions; sands, gravels, and clays were eroded and deposited
by streams and in lakes; and sand dunes were heaped up in many areas.
The glistening white gypsum dunes (<a href="#fig15">fig. 4</a>) of White Sands National
Monument, built up into 50-foot-high mounds windward of gypsiferous
Lake Lucero, are spectacular products of the wind.</p>
<p>The Rio Grande, in its present valley, probably is only as old as mid-Pleistocene,
born during late uplift of its headwater mountains, the San
Juan and Sangre de Cristo ranges in southern Colorado and northern New
Mexico&mdash;initiated by floods of meltwaters from waning mountain glaciers.
Some of the lower terraces (benches) along the Rio Grande are very
young, being dated by radiocarbon methods at 2600 b.p. (before present).
Until shackled by Elephant Butte Dam in 1916, and smaller dams up and
down the valley, the Rio Grande switched its course with every large
springtime flood. Even with these man-made controls, the Rio carves new
channels during floods and covers flooded fields with silt as the high waters
recede.</p>
<h3>PRECAMBRIAN ERA</h3>
<p>The highest points in New Mexico are in the north-central region.
Here, along the backbone of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, tower
Wheeler Peak (13,160 feet above sea level), northeast of Taos, and South
Truchas Peak (13,102 feet), northeast of Santa Fe. Snow lingers on these
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
lofty spires all year around except during an especially hot August. Highest
peaks&mdash;they must be capped by the youngest rocks. But no, the quartzites
and gneisses, hard rocks made up of quartz and feldspar, that hold up these
pinnacles against the attack of water and ice are among the oldest rocks
known in the Southwest&mdash;perhaps as much as two billion years old. These
Precambrian rocks lay deep beneath the earth&rsquo;s surface from early Paleozoic
time (500 m.y. ago?) until early Neogene time, then were uplifted along
great breaks in the earth&rsquo;s crust, uplifted slowly and intermittently during
the span of time from about 20 m.y. ago to perhaps 1 m.y. ago.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="639" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 4. <span class="sc">Gypsum dunes of White Sands</span></p>
</div>
<p>How did these ancient rocks form? What did New Mexico look like
during the dawn of geologic history? The record in stone is fragmentary.
But about two billion or so years back, thick masses of quartz sandstone
were laid down in north-central New Mexico, as well as vast lenses of
mud, and some beds of feldspar-rich sandstone. Volcanic activity was
intense; huge flows of rhyolite and andesite were poured out over most of
the state, and these in turn, along with the muddy and sandy sediments,
were intruded by enormous masses of hot granite. Mile-high mountains
were formed, and during the stretch of this early geologic time, called
the Precambrian Era, the high peaks were eroded by rain, wind, and sun
until some were worn down to featureless plains sloping toward the ancient
ancestral oceans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="456" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 5. <span class="sc">Staurolite twin crystals in mica schist</span></p>
</div>
<p>These Precambrian rocks now make up the cores of such mountain
ranges as the Sandias east of Albuquerque, the Sangre de Cristo range
near Santa Fe, the Pedernal Hills south of Clines Corners, the Burro
Mountains southwest of Silver City, the Brazos Range east of Tierra
Amarilla, the Zuni Mountains southwest of Grants, and the San Andres
Mountains west of White Sands. As seen in Tijeras Canyon east of
Albuquerque, the bulk of the ancient rocks are gray to pinkish granite
and granite gneiss, speckled by crystals of biotite, microcline, orthoclase,
and quartz. Quartzites (hardened sandstones), greenstone, and foliated
mica schists (<a href="#fig16">fig. 5</a>) are the older rocks that were intruded by granitic
magmas about 1350 million years ago&mdash;as indicated by dating of radioactive
isotopes, K-Ar and Rb-Sr. Locally, pegmatite dikes, a late-cooling, large-crystal
stage of the granites, crisscross the granite and contain excellent
crystals of quartz, feldspar, and mica, as well as less common minerals.
The famous Harding pegmatite near Dixon, about forty miles north of
Santa Fe, contains beryl, columbite-tantalite, lepidolite mica, spodumene,
and other rare minerals. Some of these crystals are ten feet in length!</p>
<h3>PALEOZOIC ERA</h3>
<p>There are some primitive types of plant and animal life known from
Precambrian rocks outside of New Mexico but the earliest beds that contain
abundant fossils are those of Cambrian age, 500 to 600 m.y. old.
Cambrian rocks in New Mexico are in the Bliss Sandstone, a reddish brown
iron-rich bed, 50 to 200 feet thick, that occurs only in the southern part
of the state. There it can be seen, for example, along the bold east-facing
escarpment of the San Andres Mountains or the west-facing cliffs of the
Caballo Mountains, as a dark band resting on the pinkish Precambrian
granitic rocks. It is a shallow-sea sand, deposited on the northeastern edge
of the Cambrian seas. Scattered amid the brown-stained quartz, red hematite,
and green glauconite are broken shells of trilobites and primitive
brachiopods. Northern New Mexico was a low, broad island during Cambrian
time, a source of some of the sands in the Bliss Sandstone.</p>
<p>During the Ordovician Period, 425 to 500 m.y. ago, upper sands of
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
the Bliss as well as overlying limestones and dolomites were deposited in
the shallow warm seas of southern New Mexico; these latter rocks are
the El Paso Limestone and Montoya Dolomite. The Ordovician seas teemed
with invertebrate life. Fifteen-foot-long cephalopods, as much as a foot in
diameter, ruled the shallow salt-water bottoms, munching on the abundant
trilobites and the moss animals, the bryozoans. Numerous brachiopods,
corals, snails, and clams also thrived, with many of the Ordovician carbonate-rock
beds literally being made up of these fossil remains. Near
El Paso, these limy fossiliferous beds are nearly 2000 feet thick, but they
thin northward to a knife edge in thickness near Mockingbird Gap at
the north end of the San Andres Mountains. Parts of northwestern New
Mexico may have been low islands exposed to the sun and erosion during
Ordovician time, but most of the state was probably within an extensive
shallow ocean. Later, erosion removed the Ordovician rocks from central
and northern New Mexico.</p>
<p>Silurian strata, the brown Fusselman Dolomite, deposited during the
middle of that period (400 to 425 m.y. ago), remain only in the southern
and southeastern parts of the state, thinning out northward from the 1000-foot-thick
bed near El Paso. The extent of these middle Silurian seas is
not known, but most of central and northern New Mexico was undergoing
erosion during late Silurian time. The northward thinning of the
Fusselman Dolomite is due chiefly to this erosion, evidenced by the
knobby, ridged and channeled top surface of the Fusselman. Brachiopods
and corals are the most abundant fossils in the Fusselman Dolomite; elsewhere,
Silurian rocks are known for the sea scorpions or eurypterids, which
attained a length of nine feet, and for the complete remains of primitive
fishes.</p>
<p>During early and middle Devonian time (345 to 400 m.y. ago), most of
New Mexico was a lowland rotting beneath the sun. Fossiliferous Devonian
rocks are unknown in the north-central part of the state but occur beneath
the surface in the Four Corners region of northwestern New Mexico and
the adjoining states. These rocks are of late Devonian age and consist of
lower dolomite and sandstone, middle shale and dolomite, and the upper
Ouray Limestone.</p>
<p>In southern New Mexico, a uniform blanket of dark limy muds, called
the Percha Shale, was deposited during late Devonian time. This shale
marks a great change from the limestones of earlier ages. In part, it is of
black muds deposited in widespread or in local stagnant basins and in
part calcareous fossiliferous muds in which abundant invertebrate life
was buried. The clay and quartz silt that make up the rocks were a weathered
residuum that had accumulated, during the long period of late
Silurian and early and middle Devonian times, on the lowland of central
and northern New Mexico.</p>
<p>Except in the stagnant basins, invertebrate life was prolific, brachiopods,
bryozoans, and corals being especially numerous. Fossil fish remnants,
chiefly teeth, are abundant in some of the sandy units, and outside of
New Mexico the earliest amphibians occur in upper Devonian rocks. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
oldest definitely known assemblage of land plants occurs in the Devonian,
and forests containing forty-foot-high trees spread over the uplands. Such
tree ferns, horsetail rushes, and lycopods (spiked-leafed trees) may have
grown in profusion on the swampy lowlands near Albuquerque&rsquo;s and
Santa Fe&rsquo;s present sites, far north of the muddy Devonian seas of southern
New Mexico.</p>

<p>Mississippian rocks (310 to 345 m.y. old) probably were deposited
over most of New Mexico. Subsequent erosion removed much of the
Mississippian beds in northern New Mexico. The remnants, less than
100 feet thick in most places, are of lower sandy and shaly beds overlain
by massive crinoidal limestones, the Arroyo Penasco Formation of the
Nacimiento and Sandia mountains and the Tererro Formation of the
Sangre de Cristo range east of Santa Fe.</p>
<p>In southern New Mexico, the Mississippian beds are thick and widespread,
being more than 1000 feet in thickness in the southwestern panhandle.
There the rock units are the Escabrosa Limestone of the southwest
or the Lake Valley Limestone of the south-central part of the state. These
are massive fossiliferous limestones precipitated in shallow extensive seas
abounding with invertebrate life. Huge gardens of the sea lilies, crinoids,
spread over the area, their remains mingled with those of lacy moss animals,
the bryozoans, and with brachiopods and corals. Locally, as in the
region of the Sacramento and San Andres mountains and Black Range,
moundlike fossil reefs, called bioherms, were built. Some of these bioherms
in the Sacramento Mountains are mounds of fossiliferous limestones 350
feet high and several thousand feet in diameter. Beds on their flanks dip
as much as 35 degrees and are made up of broken &ldquo;fossil hash&rdquo; calcite
sands. One can stand at the base of these huge limestone hills and almost
hear the ancient waves breaking against the reef and see the dying struggle
of the brachiopod (<a href="#fig17">fig. 6</a>) that left his shell in the reef-flank sands.</p>
<p>To the south, beginning near the present site of White Sands, dark
cherty limestones were laid down in stagnant waters, to become the Rancheria
Limestone. This black to reddish brown siliceous limestone is more
than 300 feet thick near El Paso. There its thin beds break down into slabs
that resemble a jumbled woodpile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Northern New Mexico was above sea level during late Mississippian
time; in some areas caves developed in the porous limestones, and in other
places the limestones were eroded to a residuum of chert and red clay.
The land must have looked like the karst areas of Indiana, Kentucky, and
Illinois today&mdash;with lost rivers flowing into sink holes, numerous caves, and
many underground rivers. Only the southernmost part of the state was
awash in the late Mississippian seas, and in these salt waters, rocks of
the Helms and Paradise formations settled. They are typical nearshore beds
of yellowish limy sandstone, green limy shales, and brown sandy oolitic
limestones. Plant fossils occur intermingled with marine animal remains;
the plant fragments were washed into the shallow seas from the land areas
of the central and northern parts of the state.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvanian Period (280 to 310 m.y. ago) was a time of change.
Previously, northern New Mexico had been an emergent lowland or barely
awash in shallow waters, while to the south shallow but extensive seas
held sway, the spawning ground of the vertebrates and invertebrates that
evolved between 310 and 600 m.y. <span class="small">B.C.</span> But mountains were built during
the Pennsylvanian, and the whole pattern of land and sea was altered.
The sun rose on north-south aligned ranges interspersed with north-south-trending
seas (<a href="#fig20">fig. 7</a>). Somewhere north of Albuquerque a mighty range
of mountains, the Uncompahgre Range, arose to shed rock debris into
adjoining ocean basins. To the southeast, a lower but prominent range,
the Pedernal Mountains, stretched from the present-day Pedernal Hills
southward to somewhere near Ruidoso and Pi&ntilde;on. Rocks eroded from
this landmass were dumped westward into the Orogrande basin which
occupied the region near the present-day White Sands; there as much as
3000 feet of beds accumulated&mdash;impure sandstones, dark shales, fragmental
limestones, and even some gypsum during the end phase of Pennsylvanian
sedimentation.</p>
<p>Rocks filled the Delaware basin in southeastern New Mexico&mdash;limestones,
sandstones, and black shales that now produce oil and gas. In
northwestern New Mexico west of Grants and mostly west of the Zuni
Mountains, a low land area, the Zuni Islands, was the source of eroded
residuum released into an ocean channelway that ran north-northwest
through central New Mexico from El Paso to Farmington. And in the
northeast, granite hills of the Sierra Grande Arch stood above the shallow
Pennsylvanian seas.</p>
<p>In the Four Corners region, broken rock from the Uncompahgre Range
was rushed westward into the Pennsylvanian-age Paradox Basin. Amid
the clastic limestones, black shale, gypsum, and salt of this basin are oil-bearing
lenses. Today, oil wells pump this black &ldquo;gold&rdquo; from the ancient
rocks&mdash;wells almost in the shadow of Shiprock&rsquo;s famous spire.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvanian Period was a time of coal making on the greatest
scale in the earth&rsquo;s history. Extensive swamps and marshes, the habitat of
peat and ultimately coal, were almost lacking in New Mexico. Thus, only
thin scattered lenses of coal occur in the Pennsylvanian beds of the state.
The lands of this period were covered by tree ferns, scale trees, horsetail
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
rushes, and primitive conifers. In the shallow seas, the dominant invertebrates
were fusulinids (<a href="#fig21">fig. 8</a>), small-shelled protozoans shaped like grains
of wheat. Abundant cockroaches, large dragonflies, and spiders swarmed
over the land.</p>

</div>
<h4>Permian Rocks</h4>
<p>The Permian Period (230 to 280 m.y. ago) dawned with renewed rising
of the highlands in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado.
Floods of red sand and clay, washed from the rotting hills, wiped out the
seas of northern and central New Mexico, and intertongued southward
with marine limestones. These early Permian rocks are the Hueco Limestone
near El Paso, there 2200 feet thick, the Abo Redbeds near Albuquerque,
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
and the upper Sangre de Cristo Redbeds southeast of Santa Fe.
Wherever the redbeds crop out, their dark reddish brown hue, speckled
and striped with spots and streaks of green, enlivens the drab gray-and-brown
landscape. Some of the reddish coloring is from angular grains of
red to orange feldspar, but most is in thin brilliantly tinted skins of hematite
that coat the sand grains and saturate the clays. In northern and central
New Mexico, amphibians and other primitive vertebrate animals lived
amid the red soils and sands; their bones and imprints have been preserved
on thin flat slabs of sandstone that now decorate sidewalks and patios.</p>

<p>The early Permian seashore, where limy muds beyond the surf intermingled
with red sandy muds swept from the north, vacillated somewhere
north of Alamogordo with each sea-level change. Amid the breakers,
and as submarine banks in the shallow waters, reefs grew&mdash;moundlike
masses of shell debris and calcite mud trapped among frondlike calcareous
algae. Near Tularosa, these algal &ldquo;bioherms&rdquo; are sixty feet high and extend
within broad belts half a mile wide. In southeastern New Mexico, these
buried &ldquo;Abo&rdquo; reefs have yielded much oil.</p>
<p>By the middle of Permian time, the southern Colorado mountains had
been worn down to low hills that lay north of an extensive sea covering
most of New Mexico. From Santa Fe south to White Sands and southeastward
almost to Carlsbad, very shallow marine waters were alternately
stifled by pale-red sandy muds or evaporated by the sun. The results were
alternating beds of pale-red sandstone, gypsum, and silty dolomitic limestone,
called the Yeso Formation. Locally, as near Carrizozo, thick deposits
of rock salt also were precipitated, and the Yeso there is about 4000 feet
thick. At this time, the Delaware basin of southeastern New Mexico saw
the beginning of its most spectacular events, the building of the Capitan
and Goat Seep reefs. This basin&mdash;a huge oval south of Carlsbad and east
of Carlsbad Caverns&mdash;had been &ldquo;deep&rdquo; sea during most of Pennsylvanian
time, but it was a more distinct geographic feature during the Permian.
While the pale-red sands, gypsum, halite, and dolomitic limestones of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
Yeso Formation were laid down to the north and northwest, the Delaware
basin was rimmed by a low, broad bank of fossil-hash calcite sand, now
called the Victorio Peak Limestone. In the basin, in deep stagnant waters,
black sandy limestone and black shale of the Bone Spring Formation were
deposited.</p>
<p>A sheet of white quartz sand filled the late Yeso seas; the resulting
Glorieta Sandstone, about 200 feet thick, prominently caps Glorieta Mesa.
Its cliffs are a familiar sight to travelers on the Santa Fe Railway at Glorieta
Pass. The Coconino Sandstone in the Grand Canyon area of Arizona is
the western part of the Glorieta. This &ldquo;clean&rdquo; sand&mdash;lacking intermixed
mud&mdash;marks the continued lowering of the southern Colorado uplands.
Broad seas then spread over all but northern New Mexico and a thick (600
to 1000 feet) persistent marine unit, the San Andres Limestone, was laid
down. Much oil is produced in southeastern New Mexico from this dark-gray
unit of limestones and dolomites. The rich agricultural region stretching
from Roswell to Artesia depends on underground water gained from
the San Andres Limestone, water that falls as rain and snow on the Sacramento
Mountains, seeps underground into the cracks and caverns within
the San Andres, and flows eastward downslope to the Pecos Valley.</p>
<p>The delicate balance between land and sea swung upward at the end
of San Andres time as these late Permian seas retreated to southern
New Mexico. The deep Delaware basin was the only persistent marine
body of water. It was rimmed by magnificent towering barrier reefs, the
Goat Seep and Capitan reefs that now are host to Carlsbad Caverns. These
reefs were similar to the present-day Great Barrier Reef of Australia, except
that the Capitan and Goat Seep reefs surrounded an inland sea whereas
the Australian reef borders a continent. The Capitan reef is about 400 miles
long, and other than oceanward channels cut through to the south, completely
encircled the 10,000-square-mile Delaware basin. At its heyday, the
Capitan reef was barely awash, and teeming with life, in contrast to the
silent, stagnant deeps of the Delaware basin which were about 2000 feet
below sea level only a few miles away from the barrier reef. On the steep
slope into the basin, huge slump blocks of fossiliferous reef limestone slid,
mingling with fossil-hash sand. These &ldquo;flank&rdquo; beds dip steeply from the
massive reef core to interfinger with the black sandy limestones of the
basin.</p>
<p>The Delaware basin was a marine feature throughout Late Paleozoic
time; its northwestern border is now marked by the southeast-trending
front of the Guadalupe Mountains southeast of Carlsbad; its north edge
was east-northeast of Carlsbad, and it extended southward into West Texas.</p>
<p>Shallow &ldquo;shelf&rdquo; seas reached irregularly and intermittently northward
and northwestward from the Capitan reef and mingled with low islands
throughout all but southeastern New Mexico. Landward, away from the
Delaware basin, the rocks change from massive, thick, light-gray limestones
of the reefs into thin units of thin-bedded dolomite, then abruptly into
alternating beds of gypsum and redbeds, the Artesia Group of rocks, and
finally, marking the distant shorelines, into thin units of red mudstone and
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
red sandstone, the Bernal Formation. Evaporation of sea water was excessive,
and average temperatures high; the climate varied from semiarid in
northwestern New Mexico to subtropical in the Delaware basin area&mdash;a
contrast and a similarity to today&rsquo;s climate.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="605" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 9. <span class="sc">Castile gypsum sample</span></p>
</div>
<p>Latest Permian time saw the dramatic end of the Paleozoic Era. Most
of New Mexico was uplifted above sea level, with only the Delaware
basin remaining as a land-locked sea, much like the Caspian Sea today,
but with channels open periodically southward to the ocean. The rocks of
this waning part of the Permian are called the <i>Ochoan Series</i>; they show
an abrupt and striking change from the underlying Carlsbad reef limestones
and associated black basin-filling limestones up into the laminated
gypsum-anhydrite of the basal Ochoan rocks, the Castile formation. Normal
marine conditions ended almost instantaneously. Excess of evaporation
lowered the water level of the inland sea; the accumulated brine
(concentrated salty sea water) killed the life on and near the Capitan
reef, and thick beds of anhydrite were precipitated. The lowest beds of the
Ochoan Series, the Castile Anhydrite, and the overlying Salado Salt, mostly
filled the deep depression that was the Delaware basin; the upper beds, the
Rustler Dolomite and Dewey Lake Redbeds, lap over the edges of the
basin and in places rest irregularly upon the Capitan limestone.</p>
<p>These are unusual rocks. The Castile (about 1800 feet thick) is thinly
banded, with thicker bands (laminae, thin layers) of light-gray gypsum-anhydrite
alternating with thin laminae of dark-brown calcite (<a href="#fig24">fig. 9</a>).
This lamination is believed due to annual changes, the brown calcite being
precipitated during the summer and the gray anhydrite during the winter.
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
On the surface, the calcium sulfate mineral is gypsum, but at depths of
about 600 feet, these laminae are anhydrite. Addition of water to anhydrite
has changed it to gypsum wherever ground water penetrated the laminae.</p>
<p>The Salado Salt, about 2000 feet thick, is almost entirely of rock salt
(halite), with important interbeds of potassium-rich minerals&mdash;red sylvite,
gray langbeinite, brownish bitter-tasting carnallite, and pale-red polyhalite.
As all these salts are highly soluble in water, the Salado Salt nowhere
&ldquo;crops out&rdquo; at the surface. East of Carlsbad, however, the potash-rich
beds are mined underground, and supply about ninety per cent of
the United States&rsquo; production&mdash;used chiefly as fertilizer.</p>
<p>The arid period of Salado Salt evaporation changed slightly as the
dolomites and anhydrites of the Rustler Dolomite were laid down in the
last drying moments (geologically speaking) of the Permian. Then as the
seas retreated to the south, the fine-grained red sands and silts of the
Dewey Lake Redbeds were spread as a thin blanket over the low lands
basking under the hot Permian sun. This was a time of dying; whole
races of vertebrate and invertebrate animals were wiped out, to be known
today only from their fossil remains. As the dim unmarked episode of
latest Permian time merged into the Triassic, an inkling of coming life was
recorded in the rocks. The amphibians were more modern types, and they
gave rise to the most striking of early land animals, the reptiles. This was
the beginning of the conquest of the land by the reptiles, which culminated
later in the dinosaurs, and was aided by the retreat of shallow seas from
the continents, a change survived chiefly by the species adapted to living
on land.</p>
<h3>MESOZOIC ERA</h3>
<p>The Mesozoic Era dawned in New Mexico on extensive plains, except
for a northwest-trending range in the extreme north-central part of the
state. During this, the early part of the Triassic Period (180 to 230 m.y.
ago), sands and muds eroded from New Mexico were carried westward
to northeastern Arizona where they now form the Moenkopi Formation,
the brilliant reds and purples of the Painted Desert region. Uplands arose
in late Triassic time in southwestern New Mexico. Along with mountains
in south-central Colorado, these highlands were torn apart by water and
wind, and the detritus was swept into sheets of brightly colored sand and
shale. These beds are thickest (about 2000 feet) along the New Mexico&mdash;Texas
line east of Roswell and in west-central New Mexico (near Grants)
extending westward into northeastern Arizona. The eastern Triassic rocks
are the redbeds of the Dockum Group with the lower Santa Rosa Sandstone
and the upper Chinle beds. The northwestern rocks are the Chinle
Formation overlain by the redbeds of the Wingate Sandstone.</p>
<p>The Chinle Formation is of special scenic interest as its beds contain
the silicified trees so well shown at Petrified Forest National Monument.
These varicolored rocks&mdash;red, purple, green, and gray&mdash;also decorate the
Painted Desert area, the wide valley of Rio San Jose east of Laguna, and
flank Interstate 40 (U.S. Highway 66) from the Texas line westward almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
to Clines Corners. As some beds are weathered &ldquo;ash&rdquo; beds, the highlands
were sites of volcanoes that spread their dust over much of the
Southwest. In contrast to the underlying marine Paleozoic rocks, these
Triassic beds were deposited on land by streams and in shallow lakes.
Thus the beasts that roamed New Mexico were amphibians&mdash;such as the
thick-skulled stegocephalians&mdash;and reptiles of the crocodilelike clan, the
phytosaurs. The silicified trees in the Chinle are mostly primitive pines;
some grew to heights of more than 100 feet and measure 7 feet in diameter.</p>
<p>New Mexico was featureless rolling prairie, with scattered low hills
in the northwest, during most of Jurassic time (135 to 180 m.y. ago). In
the late part of the period, the Sundance-Curtis sea and its shoreline
lagoons spread down from the north into northwestern New Mexico. Sand
dunes on its southeastern shores consolidated into the cross-bedded Entrada
Sandstone; its reddish brown cliffs rim the Rio San Jose Valley near Grants
and Gallup. In an extensive lagoon, or salt-water lake that covered most
of northwestern and north-central New Mexico, the gypsum and limestone
of the Todilto Formation were precipitated; this gypsum is the bed
mined near Rosario siding (seen between Albuquerque and Santa Fe) by
the Kaiser Gypsum Company, and near San Ysidro on White Mesa by
the American Gypsum Company. The Todilto salty basin was overwhelmed
by reddish sands and silts of the Summerville Formation, washed
chiefly from the south, and by the multicolored sands of the Zuni Sandstone
(exposed at El Morro), and then the stream and wind-blown sands
and clays of the varicolored Morrison Formation were laid down in northern
New Mexico. Petrified wood and bone fragments are abundant in
the Morrison beds&mdash;along with uranium&mdash;but no fossil finds in New Mexico
equal those in the Morrison Formation of Dinosaur National Park,
Utah.</p>
<p>Much of North America, including southern New Mexico, was land
during the Jurassic. In the streams and lakes were many kinds of fishes,
amphibians, reptiles, snails, crustaceans, and water bugs; on dry land
were hordes of reptiles, small primitive mammals, and ants; in the air
were flying reptiles, the earliest known birds, moths, and butterflies. The
earth was ruled by the reptiles, with the dinosaurs dominant&mdash;some being
the most ponderous land animals of all earth history. Such were Stegosaurus
and Brachiosaurus, the latter 85 feet long and weighing 50 tons.</p>
<p>The Cretaceous Period (70 to 135 m.y. ago) was one of great contrast
in New Mexico. During Early Cretaceous time, most of the central and
northern parts of the state were low lands torn by erosion, while thick
piles of conglomerate, sandstone, and shale accumulated in depressions in
the southwestern corner. Huge volcanoes near Lordsburg added their hot
ashes, bombs, and flows to the sedimentary detritus, and thick fossiliferous
limestones were laid down in muddy and sandy waters of the sea&mdash;the
shoreline fluctuated over tens of miles in areas south of Lordsburg, Deming,
and El Paso. These Early Cretaceous beds total 20,000 feet in thickness
in some areas. In eastern and northeastern New Mexico, in contrast, thin
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
sheets of quartz sand were deposited by streams on the edge of a shallow
sea, and black muds in local lagoons.</p>
<p>Rock beds thousands of feet thick were laid down in northern and
central New Mexico during Late Cretaceous time, whereas most of the
southern part of the state was above sea level and was being eroded by
tireless winds and streams. The shorelines made parallel northwest-trending
bands across the state. These are now marked by beach sands, some
of which are speckled by black minerals, high in rare elements titanium,
niobium, and zirconium. Northwestern and central New Mexico was a
battleground of the land and sea, with the beaches advancing and retreating
fifty or a hundred miles during an instant of geologic time. Stream
sands and coal beds lie landward from the beach sands which, in turn,
mingle seaward with black limy shales that were flushed into the seas. The
lowest of these rocks is the Dakota Sandstone&mdash;famous as an artesian
aquifer in the High Plains areas of states to the northeast&mdash;Colorado, the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming, and Montana. Above is the black
Mancos Shale, which in turn is overlain by the Mesaverde Group.</p>
<p>The transitions from coal swamps and stream sands to beach deposits
and then into marine black shales is characteristic of the Mesaverde in
northwestern and north-central New Mexico. To the northeast, beds of
the same age were laid down in an extensive muddy sea that stretched
far to the east; the Pierre Shale and Niobrara chalky limestone that underlie
the plains northeast of Las Vegas are typical. The cliff-forming sandstones
and coal beds near Gallup are part of the Mesaverde Group and
rim the entire San Juan Basin. Above are similar rocks such as the Kirtland
Shale, Pictured Cliffs Sandstone, and Fruitland Formation that underlie
valleys cut in the shales and cliffs carved from the sandstones in the
northwest corner of New Mexico near Farmington.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Cretaceous, the Laramide &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; began,
and New Mexico along with most of North America emerged from beneath
the seas, to be high and dry to the present. The revolution, an extensive
upheaval of the earth&rsquo;s crust, saw uplift of the San Juan Mountains
area in southwestern Colorado and large volcanoes spouting fire and
ashes nearby. Fragments of the eroded mountains and debris from these
andesitic volcanoes were flushed southward by streams and steam to settle
as thick piles of mud, sandstone, and conglomerate, the McDermott and
Animas formations in the San Juan Basin. The last moment of Cretaceous
time, if we could be so precise, was ushered out almost unnoticed&mdash;with
mountains rising to the north and the andesitic-quartz detritus being
laid down to the south in the upper beds of the Animas Formation.</p>
<p>Similarly, mountains arose during Late Cretaceous time in north-central
New Mexico and south-central Colorado, about on the site of the present-day
Sangre de Cristo range northeast of Taos, and shed erosional gravels
and muds into the Raton Basin area. Alluvial fan gravels and sands grade
eastward into dark muds and coals laid down in swamps and on floodplains.
These rocks now cap the rugged mesas seen northwest of the Santa Fe
Railway from Raton southward&mdash;the cliff-forming Trinidad Sandstone and
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
the dark siltstones, sandstones, black shales, and coal beds of the Vermejo
and Raton formations. The Kaiser Steel Corporation mine near Koehler
extracts coal from these beds. Again, the exact end of the Cretaceous is
marked only by some obscure boundary between beds, in that area within
the Raton Formation.</p>
<p>During the Cretaceous Period, the deciduous trees&mdash;such as the oak,
maple, poplar, and elm that dominate today&rsquo;s flora&mdash;became common. The
covered-seed plants, the angiosperms, are the most notable of the Cretaceous
plants, but the development of the modern floras was an antecedent to
the great expansion of mammals and birds during the following Cenozoic
Era. Reptiles ruled the earth, led by the dinosaurs (<a href="#fig25">fig. 10</a>) and their distinctive
group, the horned large-skulled ceratopsians such as Triceratops.
The small, hairy, warm-blooded mammals were still insignificant creatures
that ran from their huge dinosaur lords, but they ate reptile eggs, and so
excelled the sluggish reptiles in mental and physical activity that they
adapted swiftly to the changing environments of the Laramide revolution&mdash;and
became dominant as the pea-brained reptiles were unable to stand
the changes.</p>
<p>The shallow seas of the Cretaceous swarmed with invertebrate life;
foraminifers (unicellular protozoans) in uncountable billions make up large
parts of the chalky limestones. Mollusks, particularly clams like oysters and
the heavy ribbed Inoceramus, and complexly sutured cephalopods, the
ammonites, as well as the internal-shelled belemnoids (that look like cigars),
were most numerous among larger marine animals. Reef builders in southwestern
New Mexico were the peculiarly corallike clams, the rudistids.
Widespread warm humid climates seem to have prevailed throughout
the state during most of the Cretaceous.</p>
<h3>LANDSCAPES AND MINERAL RESOURCES</h3>
<p>Thus as the Cretaceous seas withdrew from New Mexico, the Cenozoic
Era dawned, and never again have marine waters shaped the landscapes.
The rocks, Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, and their
ancient movements determine New Mexico&rsquo;s spectacular landscapes. They
tell tales of the endless war between erosion and hard rock, show the deposition
of sediments, their uplift, and their eventual destruction. The
result is striking scenery&mdash;volcanic mountains, as Mount Taylor, Sierra
Blanca, Valle Grande&mdash;fresh lava flows near Carrizozo and Grants&mdash;volcanic
necks like Shiprock and Cabezon&mdash;White Sands, the work of the wind&mdash;El
Morro, Enchanted Mesa, Acoma, and badlands near Santa Fe, the result
of weathering and erosion&mdash;great fault-line escarpments of the Sandia,
Manzano, San Andres, and Sacramento mountains&mdash;the work of underground
waters at Carlsbad Caverns. And man adds his erosive powers&mdash;the
huge open-pit copper mine at Santa Rita and countless excavations
for rock to build homes, to straighten highways.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The sun can be harsh and hot, the rain sparse, the winter nights fierce
cold. But within the rocks are natural resources undreamed of by the early
Indians, almost untouched by the Spanish, and with potential beyond
vision for the future. Water, being scarce, is one of the more important
resources. With an average yearly precipitation of only fifteen inches, and
more than half of the state receiving less than that average, water is a problem!
Farming must depend upon irrigation, the water being drawn from
streams or &ldquo;mined&rdquo; from underground &ldquo;pools&rdquo; where it had been accumulating
for centuries.</p>
<p>Forests, game, and fish are lucrative resources somewhat unexpected
in a semiarid state; sheep and cattle&mdash;in this the stronghold of the cowboy,
famous in gunfighter lore&mdash;each total more than a million. New Mexico&rsquo;s
1965 mineral production, valued at $781.9 million, ranked seventh among
the states. Principal commodities won from the rocks, in order of value,
were oil, potash, natural gas, uranium, copper, sand and gravel, zinc, coal,
crushed stone, and perlite. Sizeable quantities of barite, beryl, carbon
dioxide, cement, clays, gem stones, gold, gypsum, helium, iron ore, lead,
limestone, magnesium compounds, manganese, mica, molybdenum, pumice,
salt, silver, sulfur, and vanadium were also mined. The huge open-pit
copper mine at Santa Rita, the many uranium mines near Grants, the
underground potash mines near Carlsbad, and the thousands of oil and
gas wells in the northwestern and southeastern parts of the state are typical
of man-made landscape features attributable to mineral exploitation in
New Mexico. Numerous old mine dumps, rotting mine shafts, and spooky
ghost towns are reminders of past fortunes won and lost.</p>
<p>The rocks, the work of water, wind, and sun, and the not insignificant
upheavals by man have shaped New Mexico&rsquo;s landscapes. Blended with
its blue skies, warm sun, and the products of three cultures&mdash;Indian, Spanish,
and American&mdash;the rocks and their movements have made the landscapes
a land of enchantment.</p>

<p>The cultural heritage of New Mexico is a rich and colorful one, blending
as it does the three separate traditions of Indian, Spanish, and Anglo-American.
Of these, the lifeways of the Indian, ancient and modern, are
of particular interest to both the visitor and resident. These were the first
inhabitants of the New World, whose roots extend back in time many
thousands of years before the first European set foot here. People who had
adapted themselves to the varied and often harsh environments of desert,
plain, valley, canyon, and mountain; who witnessed the disappearance
of the large mammals of the Pleistocene Ice Age and concomitant changes
in climate and vegetation; the first prospectors and miners seeking flint,
obsidian, turquoise, clay, salt, and mineral pigments; early traders exchanging
valued minerals and handicrafts for shells of the coastal regions;
hunters and farmers, architects and builders, civic and religious leaders,
philosophers and critics, skilled craftsmen and artists, explorers and soldiers&mdash;all
ancient counterparts of those who were to follow.</p>
<p>In 1540, when the train of soldiers in the company of Coronado&rsquo;s Spanish
Expedition entered the unknown lands later called New Mexico, four
groups of native Americans were established residents in the area. Along
the arable valley of the Rio Grande and its tributaries, and in several outlying
areas were the adobe and stone apartment-house villages of the
Pueblo Indians, whose livelihood was based largely on agriculture. East
of the mountains were scattered bands of Plains Indians, Eastern Apaches,
who were nomadic hunters following the herds of buffalo that ranged
across the vast grasslands of the High Plains. Western Apaches were dispersed
in small bands of hunters and gatherers of wild foods through the
mountainous country to the west of the Rio Grande. A related group, the
Navajo, augmented the necessities of life gained by hunting and gathering
with subordinate agricultural crops in the Plateau region to the northwest.</p>
<p>Early contacts of the <i>conquistadores</i> were largely with the Pueblo Indians,
although they had limited knowledge of the Apaches and Navajos in
outlying districts. There was little to suggest to the Spanish invaders, except
for the ruins of long-abandoned Pueblo villages, that the fragmentary
record of thousands of years of human prehistory lay scattered in the dust
beneath their feet. Undoubtedly they would have dismissed as utter nonsense
any notion that men armed with stone-tipped spears had here
slain elephants in a marsh 12,000 years old that now lay buried beneath
shifting sands of a desert landscape. Indeed, it was not until the last quarter
of the 1800&rsquo;s that serious attempts were made to decipher the prehistoric
traces of the Pueblo Indians, whereas concrete evidence that man
had hunted long-extinct Pleistocene big game in America was not discovered
until less than forty years ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h3>EARLY HUNTERS</h3>
<p>The year 1926 was marked by the first of a series of important archeological
finds in New Mexico that were eventually to demonstrate that man
had occupied this area as much as 11,000 to 12,000 years ago. During this
period, Late Pleistocene ice sheets of continental glaciers still blanketed
parts of the northern tier of states in the vicinity of the Great Lakes, and
elephants (both mammoths and mastodons), horses, camels, giant bison,
tapirs, and ground sloths roamed the Southwest. Excavations begun in
1926 near the small town of Folsom, in northeastern New Mexico (<a href="#fig26">fig. 1</a>),
disclosed a number of fossil skeletons of a large form of extinct bison,
forerunners of the modern bison or buffalo. Among these bones were dart
or spear points of distinctive form and workmanship, characterized by
broad, shallow flutes or channels on each face (<a href="#fig27">fig. 2</a>). These artifacts, now
known as Folsom points, have since been recovered from a number of
sites in New Mexico and elsewhere in North America, commonly in association
with the remains of extinct bison. Evidently Folsom &ldquo;Man&rdquo; (whose
skeletal remains have not been discovered) was a nomadic hunter particularly
dependent upon the bison for his food supply, much as were the
later Plains Indians of historic time. Ages of from 10,000 to 11,000 years
have been obtained from charcoal and other organic remains at Folsom
camp sites by the radiocarbon method.</p>
<p>Succeeding years have seen an increasing number of valuable archeological
discoveries at camp and game-kill sites of Folsom Man and other
Early Hunters. Unquestionably, the most important of these sites is the
Blackwater Draw locality between Clovis and Portales in extreme eastern
New Mexico, where excavations for gravel disclosed a stratified sequence
of sediments that were deposited in an ancient pond and spring. Here, too,
were the characteristic Folsom points in association with the bones of
fossil bison. Below the Folsom layer, still older deposits contained the fossil
bones of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison associated with fluted spear
points that resembled those from Folsom but were generally larger and
less skillfully chipped and fluted. These points, now known as Clovis
points, are so commonly found beside the remains of mammoths in a
number of sites in the High Plains and the Southwest that their makers
are believed to have been adept at hunting these extinct elephants. Radiocarbon
dates place Clovis points in a time range of from 11,000 to 12,000
years ago.</p>
<p>In a layer above that containing Folsom points at Blackwater Draw,
several varieties of unfluted lanceolate points were found to be associated
with the bones of fossil bison. These points have been identified by various
specific names such as Plainview, Milnesand, Eden, and Scottsbluff
from excavated sites elsewhere in the High Plains region, and probably
range in age from 8000 to 10,000 years. Although the giant bison still survived
into this level of stratigraphy and time, the elephant, camel, and
horse of the Clovis level had disappeared from the area.</p>

<p>Another important discovery was made in Sandia Cave northeast of
Albuquerque. Below cave deposits containing Folsom points was an earlier
type of point among the bones of mammoth, horse, camel, and other
large Pleistocene mammals. Now identified as Sandia points, these projectile
tips are distinguished by an asymmetric stemmed form with a shoulder
on one side. The age of the Sandia points has been a subject of some
controversy, but the latest available data from charcoal in Sandia Cave
indicates an age of nearly 12,000 years, which is within the accepted range
of the Clovis points.</p>

</div>
<p>Clovis, Sandia, and Folsom points, together with related stone implements,
are at many places enclosed in sediments deposited in or adjacent
to ponds, lakes, streams, and wet meadows. These environments indicate
a former cool and more humid climate in areas that are now semiarid.
The food requirements of many of the large herbivores that lived at this
time also suggest more abundant vegetation and surface water than prevails
here today. It is not unreasonable, then, to presume that climatic
conditions contributing to the advance of continental glaciers in the Great
Lakes region, and to valley glaciers in the Rocky Mountains, should have
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
been reflected in lower summer temperatures and higher rainfall in non-glaciated
areas. The ultimate extinction of the large Pleistocene mammals
and the similar time of disappearance of the hunters who preyed upon
them may both be related to the climatic changes that followed the end
of the Ice Age in America.</p>
<h3>HUNTERS AND GATHERERS</h3>
<p>Groups of people dependent upon a different way of life from that of
the Early Hunters are known to have occupied much of the present area
of New Mexico. Although there is some suggestion of overlap in time of
these people with the Early Hunters, they appear to have become prominent
during the several thousand warm, dry years following the end
of the Pleistocene. Adapted, as they were, to a fuller utilization of the
resources of the area through the hunting and trapping of smaller game
and an emphasis on the gathering of a wide variety of wild plant foods,
these people ranged extensively across the varied terrain of the state.
Similar patterns of subsistence and artifacts are known from the Great
Basin region west of the Rocky Mountains, where they have been categorized
under the term <i>Desert Culture</i>. Local manifestations of the
Desert Culture in southeastern Arizona, extending eastward into western
and southern New Mexico, are identified as the Cochise Culture. Other
groups showing similarities with Archaic cultures to the east penetrated the
northeastern part of New Mexico at a time when the area was still
populated by Pleistocene bison.</p>
<p>Habitation sites of these gatherers are distributed in open situations
and in shelter caves. Such sites are commonly marked by milling stones
that characterize the preparation of wild foods (<a href="#fig28">fig. 3</a>), hearths, chopping
and scraping implements, and stemmed projectile points markedly different
from those used by the Early Hunters. These points were affixed to dart
shafts that were propelled with a spear thrower or <i>atlatl</i>, a device that
preceded the bow and arrow in America but is still used by Australian
Aborigines.</p>
<p>Seasonal changes in the local availability of wild foods must have necessitated
a nomadic or seminomadic way of life. The development of agricultural
techniques in the later years before the beginning of the Christian
Era, however, probably contributed to the development of a semisedentary
existence that was eventually to lead to the village life of the later periods.
The exact time of introduction of the principal agricultural crops, corn,
squash, and beans, is unknown, but evidence from west-central New Mexico
indicates their use by the Cochise people by 2500 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>
<h3>PUEBLOAN FARMERS</h3>
<p>Having acquired the techniques of deliberately planting and raising
food crops that could be stored against future needs, local populations of
Hunters and Gatherers became less dependent upon the gathering of
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
wild foods and began to construct clusters of more permanent dwellings
near cultivable land. Among the earliest recognized houses of this period
are the semisubterranean pit houses of the early Mogollon people in the
San Francisco River drainage of west-central New Mexico (<a href="#fig29">fig. 4</a>) and
of the Anasazi Basketmakers in the San Juan River drainage of northwestern
New Mexico. These cultural advances, together with the acquisition
of techniques for the manufacture of fired pottery, foreshadowed
the development of the Mogollon and Pueblo cultures at a time beginning
perhaps as early as 300 <span class="small">B.C.</span> for the Mogollon area and at least by 1
<span class="small">A.D.</span> for the Anasazi area.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="573" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 3. <span class="sc">Milling stones of the type used by the Cochise People</span>
<br />Plant foods were ground in a shallow basin metate with the small one-hand mano (hand stone). Socorro, New Mexico.</p>
</div>
<p>These two cultural groups, the Mogollon in southwestern and southern
New Mexico, whose roots extend back through the ancestral Cochise to
before 6000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and the Anasazi in the Four Corners region of northwestern
New Mexico, probably developed independently during the early
years. From about 500 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, however, there is increasing evidence of trade
relationships and eventual fusion of traits. Other groups to the west, such
as the Hohokam of Arizona, were sources of cultural influence on the
indigenous people of New Mexico. In the Mogollon and San Juan Anasazi
heartlands and in the Rio Grande Valley of central New Mexico, a pattern
of village life with elaboration of social and religious organization emerged
from the relatively simple cultures of the early years. Villages began to
assume organized form, dwellings were combined in rows of adobe and
stone structures containing a number of contiguous rooms, and subterranean
ceremonial chambers or <i>kivas</i> assumed larger and more specialized
architectural distinctiveness from the ancestral pit-house dwellings. In the
Mogollon area, the characteristic brownware pottery of the Mogollons
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
was used side by side with decorated black-on-white pottery of Anasazi
origin. The bow and arrow slowly replaced the less efficient <i>atlatl</i> and
dart. The significance of these early stages in the evolution of the Pueblo
Culture in the San Juan and upper Rio Grande areas is indicated by their
designation as the Developmental Pueblo period (Pueblo I and II).</p>

</div>
<p>The climax of these developments occurred in the interval between
1050 and 1300 <span class="small">A.D.</span> in the Classic or Great Pueblo period (Pueblo III).
Among the most impressive manifestations of this period are large stone-masonry
apartment houses, some rising to five stories in height and housing
hundreds of people. Dwellings of this type are highlights of several
well-known tourist attractions, among which are the cliff dwellings of
Mesa Verde in southwestern Colorado and the monumental ruins of
Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon (<a href="#fig30">fig. 5</a>), both products of the ingenuity
of the Anasazi Indians.</p>
<p>At the very apex of the cultural efflorescence of the Great Pueblo
period, some unknown circumstance or series of events caused abandonment
of most of the urban centers of the San Juan Anasazi and Mogollon
areas. A prolonged drouth is recorded by tree rings formed during the period
from 1276 to 1299 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Surely a drouth of this magnitude would have had
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
serious effects on people as dependent upon agriculture as were the Pueblo
Indians. There are some indications that alien and perhaps enemy people
were drifting into these areas at about this time, perhaps predecessors of
the modern Navajos and Apaches. The congested living conditions of
Pueblo villages undoubtedly contributed to unsanitary conditions and social
pressures that also may have contributed to shifts in population. Many of
these migrants moved into the homeland of the Rio Grande Anasazi in the
upper Rio Grande Valley, and to a lesser extent in the central Rio Grande
Valley. Some may have relocated at Zuni and other areas along the Little
Colorado River drainage extending westward into Arizona.</p>

<br />A multistory pueblo containing 800 rooms.</p>
</div>
<p>During the Great Pueblo period, another group showing characteristics
of both the Anasazi and of non-Puebloan people occupied an area on both
sides of the Continental Divide along the eastern margin of the San Juan
Basin. This cultural phase, known as the Largo-Gallina because of the
distribution of sites in the Largo and Gallina drainage basins, is represented
by pit houses, surface rooms, and towerlike structures with some similarities
to the dwellings of the Anasazi. The black-on-white pottery also suggests
Puebloan relationships, whereas the culinary vessels resemble those of the
Navajo.</p>
<p>Beginning at about 1300 <span class="small">A.D.</span> or shortly thereafter, a different cultural
group began to move westward from the Texas Panhandle into
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
the plains of northeastern New Mexico. These people of the Panhandle
Aspect built single-room structures and contiguous room pueblos resembling
those in use by the Anasazi of the Rio Grande and were skilled bison
hunters, farmers, and traders. This combination of traits suggests both
Puebloan and eastern traditions. Panhandle Aspect villages were abandoned
suddenly not long after 1400, perhaps as a result of the drouth recorded
by tree rings for the period from 1439 to 1454.</p>
<p>Following the shift in population of the Pueblo region, cultural changes
occurred that have led to the designation Regressive Pueblo period (Pueblo
IV) for the interval between 1300 and 1700 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Noteworthy changes during
this period include a tendency toward enlargement of villages and the
creation of new styles of pottery, accompanied by some deterioration of
the artistic creativity of the Classic period. Major ruins of this period that
are readily accessible to the public include Puye Cliff Dwellings, Tyuonyi
Pueblo in Bandelier National Monument, and Pecos Pueblo in Pecos
National Monument.</p>
<p>At the time of Coronado&rsquo;s <i>entrada</i> in 1540, there were from 60 to 70
Pueblo villages in New Mexico, most of which contained fewer than 400
inhabitants. Four or five mutually unintelligible languages were spoken,
each with several dialects, making communication between Spanish and
Indian extremely difficult. Language barriers contributed to an inadequate
documentation of the Pueblo way of life during the early years of Spanish
contact, so that we must continue to depend upon the archeological
record during the first century of Spanish colonization of the area. The
beginning of the Historic Pueblo period (Pueblo V) accordingly is commonly
set at 1700 <span class="small">A.D.</span></p>
<h3>APACHES AND NAVAJOS</h3>
<p>Little is known concerning the origin of these two related groups, who
differ markedly from the Pueblo Indians in language and cultural traits.
Their closest ties are with other Athapaskan-speaking tribes in northwestern
Canada, and available evidence indicates that they are comparative newcomers
to the Southwest. A correlation between the abandonment of sections
of the Pueblo region and pressures exerted by ancestral Apaches
and Navajos has been suggested, but definite proof of this is still lacking.
Raids against the eastern pueblos of the Galisteo Basin are reported to
have occurred in 1525. Coronado&rsquo;s expedition encountered nomadic hunters
in the plains east of Pecos in 1541, observing that they followed the
movements of herds of bison or buffalo on whom they were highly dependent
for food and shelter, lived in portable tents of tanned buffalo hides
supported by a framework of poles, and used dogs as beasts of burden.
Trade contacts with the Rio Grande pueblos included exchange of hide
&ldquo;cloaks&rdquo; for corn grown by the Pueblo Indians.</p>
<p>Related groups in western and northwestern New Mexico are even
more poorly known, as there was still less contact between them and the
Spanish explorers. Evidently some agriculture was practiced as a supplement
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
to a subsistence based largely on hunting and gathering, a pattern
of livelihood reminiscent of that of the pre-Puebloan Cochise people.</p>
<p>The succeeding years of Spanish and American colonization of New
Mexico were to be highly influenced by the Apaches and Navajos, and
also by another group of Plains Indians, the Comanches. The events
of this period, however, are discussed in a separate article.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">Frontier Forts of New Mexico</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">Robert A. Bieberman</span></p>
<p>Following President Polk&rsquo;s declaration of war against Mexico in May
1846, a United States Army force was sent from Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas
Territory, against the Mexican provinces of New Mexico and California.
This army, known as &ldquo;The Army of the West,&rdquo; was led by Gen. Stephen
W. Kearny. Upon his arrival in Santa Fe in August 1846, General Kearny
issued a proclamation which informed the citizens that New Mexico was
now a part of the United States and that he and his army and the forces
to follow would protect them and their property. General Kearny remained
in Santa Fe only one month, but during that month he appointed a governor,
judges, and other officials, started construction of a fort in Santa
Fe, and sent troops against the Navajo Indians in fulfillment of his promise
to protect the people. Kearny and his &ldquo;Army of the West&rdquo; left Santa
Fe in September 1846 to conquer California, leaving behind a detachment
of troops under the command of Col. Alexander W. Doniphan. Thus
began the role of the U.S. Army, which was to continue for the next
half century, in securing the frontier in what we now know as the State
of New Mexico.</p>
<p>History has shown that the troops stationed in New Mexico were
called upon to participate in the Mexican War and the Civil War and to
protect the newly established border between Mexico and New Mexico
from violations from both sides. However, the basic role of the military,
the role which continued for fifty years, was to protect the traveler, the
farmer, the miner, and the settler from Indian attack. Its task was made
no less difficult by the changing, unrealistic, discriminatory Indian policies
which came out of Washington during this period. When relative calm
was established, promises were forgotten and violence erupted anew.</p>
<p>The defense policy in New Mexico did not follow a set plan but gradually
evolved. Military posts were established at different places when
the need arose and were abandoned when the need diminished. A few
of the posts were occupied and used by the army throughout most of
this period. Others existed but a few months or years.</p>
<h3>FORTS</h3>
<h4>Fort Union</h4>
<p>Located twenty-seven miles northeast of Las Vegas, Fort Union became
the most important and most famous fort in the New Mexico Territory.
Established on the Santa Fe Trail in 1851, it served as supply depot
for the territory and as a base for troops engaged in the protection of traffic
along the Santa Fe Trail and of the settlements in the area from the depredations
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
of the Apaches, Utes, Comanches, and Kiowas. The site can be
reached by traveling eight miles of paved road which leaves U.S. Highway
85 one mile north of Watrous.</p>
<p>During its forty-year history, Fort Union occupied three different sites,
all within the same general area. The original fort was of log construction
which rapidly fell into disrepair. In August 1861, amid rumors of the
possible invasion of the territory by Confederate forces, construction was
begun on a new fort. This fort was of earthworks, in the form of an
eight-pointed star. It was here that the troops waited for the attack which
never came. With the passing of the Confederate threat, work was begun
in 1863 on the third fort, the remains of which are seen today.</p>
<p>Fort Union soon became the largest fort in the territory. It was constructed
in two sections, one for the garrison and one for the supply depot.
The garrison area consisted of four infantry and two cavalry barracks facing
a row of nine officers&rsquo; quarters across the parade ground. A sixty-bed
hospital was constructed. The depot area included five warehouses, mechanics
corral, transportation corral, and administration buildings. An
arsenal was built about one mile from the fort proper.</p>
<p>The buildings were constructed of adobe on stone foundations. The
roofs were flat and the walls were capped with brick copings in what has
become the territorial style of architecture.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">

<p class="pcap"><span class="small">(<i>Photo courtesy of National Park Service</i>)</span><br /><span class="sc">Ruins of Fort Union</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Fort Union was a community within itself and a lively social center.
Weary travelers on the Santa Fe Trail eagerly anticipated their arrival.
Few complaints were heard when soldiers were transferred to Fort Union,
for this was a popular assignment.</p>
<p>With the coming of the railroad and peace at last descending on the
frontier in the 1880&rsquo;s, the need for the fort diminished. But it clung to
life for a few more years, mainly because of the fond memories which
lived in the hearts of the military leaders who had been stationed there.
Finally, the end came and Fort Union was abandoned in February 1891.</p>
<p>New life came to the fort in 1955 when it became a National Monument.
The ruins have been excavated and stabilized and a fine visitors&rsquo;
center and museum has been established. Fort Union has at last assumed
its rightful place as a shrine of history. Stand on the parade ground and
survey the majesty that was Fort Union, listen for the sounds, the bugle
calls, the barklike commands of close-order drill, the creak of wagons, and
the thunder of horses&rsquo; hooves. These are the sounds of Fort Union. They
are still there if one will only pause and listen.</p>
<h4>Fort Marcy</h4>
<p>Fort Marcy was established in 1846 at Santa Fe and was named for
the then Secretary of War, W. L. Marcy. The fort was located on a hill
overlooking the city some 1000 yards northeast of the plaza. A deep ditch
or moat surrounded the massive adobe walls of the fort and a blockhouse,
within musket range, protected the only entrance. At the time of Colonel
Manfield&rsquo;s inspection trip in August 1853, the troops were quartered in
public buildings in Santa Fe, there being no quarters provided at the fort;
however, it could be occupied on a moment&rsquo;s notice. The original Fort
Marcy was abandoned in 1867 and a new one was constructed a short
distance to the west. This new site is now occupied by business and residential
properties. The War Department abandoned Fort Marcy in October
1894, the troops and equipment being moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The
site was turned over to the city of Santa Fe in 1897.</p>
<p>Fort Marcy played an important role during the military occupation of
New Mexico. It served as a base of operations against marauding Indians,
was captured and occupied for a short time by Confederate forces in 1862,
served as headquarters for the Ninth Military Department (changed to
Department of New Mexico in 1853) throughout most of this period, and
was a center for the social life of Santa Fe. Only low mounds of earth
now mark the site of Fort Marcy.</p>
<h4>Fort Wingate</h4>
<p>Fort Wingate, at the site known today, was established in 1868. It is
located on the site of a pre-existing fort at Ojo del Oso (Bear Springs)
about twelve miles east of Gallup and three miles south of U.S. Highway
66.</p>
<p>Fort Fauntleroy was established in August 1860 and was named for the

then Department Commander, Col. T. T. Fauntleroy. The name was
changed to Fort Lyon in September 1861 after Colonel Fauntleroy resigned
his commission and joined the Confederate forces. The fort was
abandoned in December 1861 as troops were concentrated at other posts to
meet the threat of invasion of the territory by Confederate forces from
the south. With the defeat of Confederate troops early in 1862, the military
returned to the Indian problem and established a post some sixty
miles to the east on the Rio de Gallo near San Rafael. This post was
named Fort Wingate in honor of Capt. Benjamin Wingate who died of
wounds received during the battle with the Confederate forces at Val
Verde. The post proved to be too far from the Navajo country for effective
control and, in 1868, was abandoned and a new Fort Wingate established
at Ojo del Oso on the site occupied earlier by Fort Fauntleroy.</p>
<p>The physical plant of the new Fort Wingate consisted of barracks,
officers&rsquo; quarters, hospital, guard house, storehouse, employees&rsquo; quarters,
corrals, barns, and various repair and storage sheds, all bordering the traditional
rectangular parade ground. Some of these buildings are in use today.</p>
<p>In 1914, 4000 Mexican refugees lived in a tent city at Fort Wingate
until peace was restored after Pancho Villa&rsquo;s revolution in Mexico. Following
World War I, it became an ordnance storage depot, and new administrative
and living quarters were built several miles west of the original fort
enclosure. This installation is known today as Fort Wingate Ordnance
Depot, and the long rows of concrete ammunition storage bunkers can be
seen from U.S. Highway 66. In 1925, the original fort enclosure was
transferred to the Department of the Interior for use as an Indian school.
Today, the parade ground is a playground and the barracks are dormitories
for the children who attend this school. The missile age came to Fort
Wingate in 1963 when a portion of the military reservation became the
launching site for test rockets which impact at the White Sands Missile
Range 200 miles to the south.</p>
<p>Fort Wingate has seen many changes during its long and colorful
history. It served well during its first 100 years and continues to serve
today.</p>
<h4>Fort Craig</h4>
<p>Fort Craig was established in the spring of 1854 on the abandonment
of Fort Conrad, nine miles north. It was named in honor of Col. L. S.
Craig who was killed by an army deserter on June 6, 1852. The remains
of Fort Craig are located on the west bank of the Rio Grande about thirty-four
miles south of Socorro and five miles, by dirt road, east of U.S. Highway
85. The fort was established to afford protection against the many
bands of Apaches that roamed this part of the territory.</p>
<p>Fort Craig was well built and became one of the best-garrisoned
military posts in New Mexico. Built on the usual rectangular plan, the
parade ground was bordered on the northeast by two double officers&rsquo; quarters;
on the northwest by the guard house, prison room, and sallyport; on
the southwest by three soldiers&rsquo; barracks each in the form of a hollow
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
square enclosing a patio; and on the southeast by various workshops, storerooms,
stables, and corrals. The commanding officers&rsquo; quarters occupied the
west corner of the parade ground and the hospital the east corner. Behind
the commanding officers&rsquo; quarters there were three large bombproof storerooms.
The entire installation was enclosed within a high wall, beyond
which a ditch encircled the fort. Gun bastions projected from the north
and south corners.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig32">

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Remnants of guard house, Fort Craig</span>
(built of basalt blocks)</p>
</div>
<p>Fort Craig was one of the most important military posts in New Mexico.
Its troops participated in many engagements with the Indian. In the
fall of 1861, troops from other posts were concentrated at Fort Craig to
meet the threatened invasion of Confederate forces from the south. In
February 1862, these troops were defeated by the Confederate invaders
in the battle of Val Verde which took place about four miles north of the
fort. Upon the withdrawal of Confederate forces from the territory later
in 1862, the troops at Fort Craig returned to the Indian problem. In
March 1885, the fort was relinquished by the army and the improvements
sold. The last soldier left in August 1885 after government property
was removed and sent to Forts Bliss and Stanton. The buildings were sold
at public auction on April 30, 1894, to the Valverde Land and Irrigation
Company for $1070.50.</p>
<p>Fort Craig is now a ruin, but the outlines of most of the buildings can
still be seen. Portions of the plastered walls of the commanding officers&rsquo;
quarters remain, as do portions of the hospital and stone guard house. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
wall and ditch surrounding the fort, gun bastions, storehouses, and cemetery
are still much in evidence. Coal marks the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop and
broken bottles the sutler&rsquo;s store. Another frontier fort has passed into history.</p>
<h4>Fort Stanton</h4>
<p>Fort Stanton was established in May 1855 on the Rio Bonito at a site
located approximately four miles east of present-day Capitan and three
miles south of U.S. Highway 380. The fort was an attempt to control the
Mescalero and White Mountain Apaches and was named for Capt. H. W.
Stanton who had been killed by Apache Indians earlier that year. Many
a soldier stationed at Fort Stanton gave up his life to an Apache during the
Indian wars.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Map of New Mexico showing location of frontier forts</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>The original fort was little more than a stockade, with few buildings
and little equipment. In August 1861, the government stores were burned
and the troops moved to Albuquerque in the face of the Confederate invasion.
Confederate troops occupied the site one month later but promptly
left after a few encounters with the Apache. The site was reoccupied by
Union troops October 1862 and, later, substantial buildings were erected,
most of which still stand.</p>
<p>With the passing of the frontier, Fort Stanton was abandoned as a
military post in August 1896, and in 1899, the installation passed to the
U.S. Public Health Service for use as a merchant marine hospital for the
treatment of tuberculosis. During World War II, a German prisoner of
war camp was established at the fort. In 1953, the hospital was closed by
the federal government because of the high cost of running the establishment.
Fort Stanton is now a state tuberculosis hospital operated by the
New Mexico Department of Public Welfare.</p>
<p>Col. Kit Carson used the fort as a base of operations while rounding up
the Mescalero and White Mountain Apaches in late 1862 and early 1863.
In 1881, the famous outlaw, Billy the Kid, was confined in the building
now used as a dental clinic while on his way to the gallows in Lincoln,
which never claimed him. Gen. John J. Pershing, as a young lieutenant,
was stationed for a time at Fort Stanton.</p>
<h4>Fort Selden</h4>
<p>Fort Selden was established in 1865 and named for Capt. Henry R.
Selden (later colonel) who distinguished himself at the battle of Val Verde,
February 21, 1862. The fort was beside the Rio Grande nine miles north
of the settlement of Do&ntilde;a Ana. The site is located along U.S. Highway
85 about seventeen miles north of present-day Las Cruces.</p>
<p>Fort Selden was one of a chain of forts established to control the
Apaches. It was on the Butterfield Trail and provided protection for the
government rope ferry which crossed the Rio Grande at nearby Leasburg.
The summit of Mt. Robledo, across the river to the west, was used as
a heliograph station, flashing messages between Fort Selden and Fort
Bliss at Franklin (El Paso, Texas).</p>
<p>The buildings of the fort were one-story adobe structures with walls
two feet thick. The installation included barracks for enlisted men, two
double officers&rsquo; quarters, a ten-bed hospital, stone guard house, storehouses,
workshop, bake shop, corrals, and a magazine with stone walls three feet
thick. The fort was rectangular in ground plan, the buildings enclosing
a parade ground.</p>
<p>Fort Selden was abandoned in 1879 when the railroads began to draw
travel away from the overland trails. It was reoccupied in 1881 when the
Apache Chiefs Victorio, Nana, and later Geronimo were on the warpath.
With the passing of the Indian problem, Fort Selden was permanently
abandoned in 1892. During World War I, the grounds of the fort were
used for cavalry maneuvers by units stationed at Fort Bliss.</p>
<p>A rather famous American once lived at Fort Selden. Gen. Douglas
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
MacArthur, as a child of four, moved with his family to the fort in 1884,
following the assignment of his father, then an infantry captain, to that
post. The family remained at Fort Selden until late in 1886.</p>
<p>Now only crumbling adobe walls mark the site of Fort Selden, once a
welcome sight to travelers in southern New Mexico. The wind, rain, and
sun have taken their toll, aided in no small way by man himself. In 1963,
through the efforts of the Do&ntilde;a Ana Historical Society, Fort Selden was
made a State Monument by the New Mexico legislature. It is to be hoped
that the fort will now be protected from further weathering and vandalism
so that the remnants of this old outpost will stand for many years to come
as a monument to the men who once manned it.</p>
<h4>Fort Cummings</h4>
<p>Fort Cummings was established in October 1863 in what is now Luna
County, New Mexico. It was located at Cooke&rsquo;s Spring, an important
watering stop on the Butterfield Trail, at the eastern edge of Cooke&rsquo;s Canyon.
Prior to the establishment of Fort Cummings, the Apaches made
frequent and fatal attacks upon travelers as they passed through the four
miles of Cooke&rsquo;s Canyon or stopped at the spring. Cooke&rsquo;s Canyon was one
of the most dangerous stretches on the Butterfield Trail. The fort was
named for Maj. Joseph Cummings who was killed by Navajo Indians
in August 1863. Its ruins can be reached by turning off State Highway
26 at Florida, sixteen miles northeast of Deming, and traveling seven miles
to the west.</p>
<p>Fort Cummings was the most elaborate and best-walled fort in New
Mexico. It covered an area 365 &times; 320 feet and was completely surrounded
by a twelve-foot-high adobe wall. The main entrance was topped by a
guard tower. Officers&rsquo; quarters occupied the west side of the parade ground,
the hospital the north side, and soldiers&rsquo; quarters the east side. The various
workshops, storerooms, offices, stables, and corrals extended along the
south side of the fort.</p>
<p>Abandoned in August 1873, Fort Cummings was reoccupied in 1880,
and then again abandoned in October 1886. Later it was used as a cattle
corral by the Carpenter-Stanley Cattle Company. The spring was walled
and covered, and the water piped to Florida.</p>
<p>Little remains of Fort Cummings today. A few weathered walls here
and there among the mesquite and creosote bushes mark the site. The
spring still flows, supplying water for the stock which now graze upon this
&ldquo;protector of the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Fort Bayard</h4>
<p>Fort Bayard, established in 1865 to protect the miners and settlers
moving into the area following the Civil War, allowed the orderly development
of what was to become New Mexico&rsquo;s most important mineral-producing
area. Named for Capt. George D. Bayard who was wounded
repeatedly during Indian forays and who died of wounds received in the
Battle of Fredricksburg (Va.) during the Civil War, the fort was located
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
about five miles southeast of Pinos Altos and about midway between the
mining towns of Pinos Altos and Santa Rita. The site is about nine miles
east of present-day Silver City, just north of State Highway 90.</p>
<p>The original fort consisted of log and adobe buildings forming a
square around the parade ground. During its thirty-four year history as
an army post, many changes and additions were made to the fort, including
the building of two-storied officers&rsquo; quarters. In 1899, the line troops
were removed and the fort was officially designated as a U.S. Army General
Hospital to treat tubercular soldiers. In 1920, the hospital was turned
over to the Public Health Department; in 1922, to the U.S. Veterans Administration;
and again, in 1966, to the State Health Department as a
facility for the care of the aged and of tuberculosis cases. It can now accommodate
more than 300 patients. The modern buildings are a far cry
from the dirt-floored log and adobe buildings of the original fort.</p>
<h3>HISTORY</h3>
<h4><i>Pre-Civil War Period.</i></h4>
<p>The period 1846 to 1861 was characterized by
constant Indian warfare. Treaties were made, then broken. Forts were
established, then abandoned, and new forts built as the military tried in
vain to cope with the problem. Punitive expeditions proved ineffective
as the Indians separated into small and predatory bands which overran
the country.</p>
<p>Forts Union, Marcy, Fauntleroy, Craig, and Stanton were established
during this period. Additional forts, whose sites have returned to the desert,
are Fort Conrad (1851), on the Rio Grande about twenty-five miles south
of Socorro; Fort Thorn (1853), on the Rio Grande about five miles north of
Hatch; Fort Fillmore (1851), on the Rio Grande about seven miles south
of Las Cruces; Fort Webster (1852), on the Mimbres River about one and
one-half miles northwest of San Lorenzo; Fort McLane (1860), at Apache
Tejo about four miles south of Hurley; and Fort Floyd (1857), on the Gila
River about two miles south of Cliff.</p>
<h4><i>Civil War Period.</i></h4>
<p>The outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 created a
new problem on the frontier in New Mexico. Confederate military leaders
moved quickly to seize control of the Southwest and California to cut off
the supply of gold to the North and divert it to the Confederacy. Confederate
troops under Col. J. B. Baylor occupied abandoned Fort Bliss at
Franklin (El Paso), Texas on July 1, 1861. Baylor began his move northward
along the Rio Grande on July 23 and quickly occupied Mesilla.
Nearby Fort Fillmore was abandoned and the Union forces retreated toward
Fort Stanton, but they were soon captured by Baylor&rsquo;s troops.
Upon the fall of Fort Fillmore, Fort Stanton was hastily abandoned on
August 2 and was taken over by the Confederates shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Gen. H. H. Sibley arrived at Fort Bliss in December 1861 to assume
command of the Confederate forces. Sibley&rsquo;s troops moved northward
along the Rio Grande and were engaged in battle by Union troops from
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
Fort Craig, under Gen. E. R. S. Canby, as they attempted to bypass the
well-garrisoned post. The Battle of Val Verde took place four miles north
of Fort Craig on February 21, 1862. After a day of bloody fighting, Sibley
emerged the victor. He occupied Albuquerque on March 2, 1862, and
Santa Fe on March 23. The Confederate forces then moved toward Fort
Union in an attempt to gain complete control of the territory. On March
27 and 28, they were met by Union forces sent out from Fort Union and
were defeated in battle near present-day Glorieta. Sibley then retreated to
Fort Bliss.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">The Confederate campaign in New Mexico</span>, 1861-1862</p>
</div>
<p>While Sibley was thus engaged, another part of his army moved across
what is now southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona and
occupied Tucson (Arizona). Gen. J. H. Carleton and his California
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
Column left Los Angeles on April 13 and cleared this area of Confederate
troops, reaching the Rio Grande on August 7. Carleton reoccupied Fort
Bliss, which had been abandoned by the Confederate troops in their
retreat.</p>
<h4><i>Post-Civil War Period.</i></h4>
<p>While the Union troops were preoccupied with
the Confederates, the Indians stepped up their raids and depredations.
With the passing of the Confederate threat, attention was once more
focused on the Indian problem. A new plan was formulated which called
for the capturing of the Indians and confining them to reservations. A
reservation (Bosque Redondo) was established late in 1862 near present-day
Fort Sumner, New Mexico, to which were eventually confined several
thousand Navajos and Mescalero Apaches. This resettlement was
not a success since the Apaches ran off and the Navajos suffered greatly
from sickness and disease. A treaty was signed with the Navajos in 1868,
and they were allowed to return to their homes, no longer a threat to the
frontier. The Mescalero Apaches were finally settled on a reservation in
their own country south of Fort Stanton, and the Jicarillas on a reservation
west of Tierra Amarilla.</p>
<p>The Mimbreno, Mogollon, and Warm Springs Apaches of southwestern
New Mexico were more of a problem. In 1871, a reservation
and Fort Tularosa were established near present-day Aragon in western
New Mexico. After a futile attempt to keep the Indians there, they were
moved in 1874 to a new reservation and military post at Ojo Caliente,
about forty miles northwest of present-day Truth or Consequences. This,
too, proved a failure and the Apaches were moved to the San Carlos
Reservation in what is now Arizona. During these attempts to locate the
Apaches on reservations, various rebellious bands of Apaches led by Victorio,
Nana, and Geronimo continued on the warpath. Geronimo and his
band surrendered in 1886 and were imprisoned in Florida. After Geronimo&rsquo;s
surrender, relative peace descended upon the frontier in New Mexico.</p>
<p>Established in the post-Civil War period were Forts Wingate (old and
new), Selden, Cummings, and Bayard, as well as Fort Lowell (1868),
near Tierra Amarilla; Fort Bascom (1863), on the Canadian River about
eight miles north of Tucumcari; Fort Sumner (1862), on the Pecos River
about five miles southeast of present-day Fort Sumner; Fort McRae (1863),
on the Rio Grande about ten miles northeast of Truth or Consequences;
and Fort West (1863), on the Gila River about two miles south of Cliff.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the railroad and cessation of hostilities with the
Indians, a new era was begun. One by one, the old forts were abandoned:
their need had passed. The colorful frontier forts of New Mexico are
just a memory now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Our National Heritage</span></h2>
<p>National Forests in the so-called &ldquo;desert&rdquo; state of New Mexico cover
more than 8.5 million acres, about 11 per cent of the state&rsquo;s area. National
Monuments and Carlsbad Caverns National Park only extend over about
430 square miles but cover ten of New Mexico&rsquo;s most scenic areas that
are of national geologic, archeologic, and historic interest. These are our
national heritage, set aside by the federal government for the perpetual
equal use of all Americans.</p>
<p>The forests cap the higher ranges of the state, except on windblown
peaks that extend above the timberline. They provide protection for the
watersheds that feed New Mexico&rsquo;s rivers, supply about 125 million board
feet of cut timber each year, and yield forage for more than 150,000 cattle
and sheep. Picnic nooks and camp grounds are plentiful, fish abound
in the rushing mountain streams, and big game awaits the hunter throughout
the forest lands. The primitive virgin wilderness is preserved in its
natural state, accessible only by pack trip, in the Gila Wilderness area
of the Diablo and Mogollon mountains north of Silver City and the Pecos
Wilderness area east of Santa Fe in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.</p>
<p>Incomparable Carlsbad Caverns is in the state&rsquo;s only National Park.
National Monuments include the glistening gypsum dunes of White
Sands, the volcanic cone of Capulin Mountain, the prehistoric ruins of
Chaco Canyon, Aztec Ruins, Bandelier, and Gila Cliff Dwellings, the
Spanish ruins at Gran Quivira, Inscription Rock at El Morro, and the
crumbling walls of old Fort Union. In the near future, Valle Grande may
be added to the National Park System and will include Valle Caldera,
one of the world&rsquo;s largest volcanic calderas, a mountainous jumble with
cool streams, thick coniferous forests, and lush high meadows.</p>
<h3 id="c8">NEW MEXICO&rsquo;S BIG SHARE OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM</h3>
<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">H. V. Reeves, Jr.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In contemplating the growth of cities and towns, the insatiable suburbs,
congested streets and highways, the acres of dump yards for discarded automobiles,
legions of billboards upstaging mountain ranges and seashores,
and the melancholy predictions of demographers who say that within
thirty years there will be twice as many of us, consider this: for New
Mexico in particular, the outlook is not utterly bleak.</p>
<p>Some ninety years ago, without anything approaching the present-day
horrible example before them, some farsighted, selfless, tireless individuals
began to work to set aside areas of outstanding scenic, scientific, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
historical interest so that they would not be engulfed by humanity. Often
against strong opposition, these benefactors succeeded in bringing about
legislation that bounded many such areas and defined laws to protect them.
The areas became national parks, monuments, and historic sites. And in
1916, the National Park Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of the
Interior, was established to administer the units of the National Park
System.</p>
<p>Today, other selfless individuals are contributing their time and effort
to bring additional areas into the National Park System before they are
lost forever. For example, Pecos ruins became a National Monument in
late 1966 (see <a href="#Page_106">page 106</a>).</p>
<p>Not every suggested area possesses the qualities that merit preservation,
qualities of national significance. Proposed areas receive careful study before
they are recommended for inclusion within the system&mdash;recommended
to the Congress by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary&rsquo;s recommendations
are based on those received from the Advisory Board on
National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings, and Monuments. This board
is composed of eleven private citizens, each of whom is competent in one
or more of the following fields: history, natural history, archeology, architecture,
conservation, and recreation.</p>
<p>Diverse in character, New Mexico&rsquo;s ten units of the National Park
System are of geologic, scenic, archeological, and historical interest. A
visit to each unit will disclose the qualities that have been judged to be
of national significance.</p>
<h4>Carlsbad Caverns National Park</h4>
<p>Incomparable Carlsbad Caverns, in southeastern New Mexico, includes
a single underground chamber so expansive that its floor could accommodate
fourteen football fields and its ceiling could hold a 22-story
building; other chambers that contain countless cave formations of great
variety of shape and color; cool and naturally circulating fresh air; and a
system of lighting that reveals the beauty and spaciousness most effectively.</p>
<p>Since the temperature within the Caverns remains at about 56&deg;F the
year round, warm clothing is needed. Comfortable shoes, too, for the
four-hour, three-mile complete tour, which starts at the natural entrance.
Shorter trips, the Big Room tours that start at the elevators in the visitor
center, take in only a part of the underground chambers. All tours are
under leadership of competent park guides who answer questions and explain
the earth processes that have resulted in the caverns and their
amazing decorations.</p>
<p>From the natural entrance, the immense main corridor of the Caverns is
followed downward 829 feet for one and three-quarters miles. This brings
visitors to the most scenic rooms (the Green Lake Room, King&rsquo;s Palace,
Queen&rsquo;s Chamber, and Papoose Room), where the stalactites, stalagmites,
and helictites reach their peak in numbers, shapes, and delicate coloring.
The trail leads upward 80 feet from the Papoose Room to the lunchroom.
Near the lunchroom is the Big Room, the most majestic of the Caverns&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
chambers. The trail around its perimeter, one and a quarter miles long, encompasses
a floor space of fourteen acres.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="571" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Hall of Giants in Carlsbad Caverns National Park</span></p>
</div>
<p>Completing the circuit of the Big Room and returning to the lunchroom,
visitors may either walk or board an elevator and ride smoothly
back to the surface.</p>
<p>How were the Caverns formed? The story began about 240 million
years ago, during the Permian Period. At that time, the two limestone
formations in which the caverns occur&mdash;the Tansill Formation and Capitan
Limestone&mdash;were deposited as part of an organic reef complex at the
edge of a warm shallow sea.</p>
<p>During subsequent periods, other seas brought in sedimentary material
that covered the reef. About 60 million years ago, earth movements, which
were responsible for the uplift of the area, fractured the reef and permitted
surrounding ground water to enter along fracture lines and begin work
in fashioning the caverns. The water at first dissolved small crevices in
the limestone. As more water came in, the crevices enlarged to cavities,
called solution pockets. Then the walls, floors, and ceilings of the pockets
dissolved and collapsed, joining the pockets, while the solution process
continued, eventually forming the huge rooms seen today.</p>
<p>Beginning about 3 million years ago and into recent times, the uplift
of the local Guadalupe Mountains and changing climates lowered the
water table. Water that had been inside the caverns drained away and was
replaced by air. Most solution stopped, but large sections of partly dissolved
walls and ceilings collapsed under their own weight. Stability was
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
finally achieved, however, and probably no rock has fallen within the
caverns during the last several thousand years.</p>
<p>Even before the collapsing ended, another phase of cavern development
had begun. Rain water and snow melt slowly seeped into the caverns.
Droplets of water, each holding a minute quantity of dissolved limestone,
appeared upon the ceilings. Exposed to the air, the droplets evaporated
and left their mineral content as calcite and aragonite&mdash;crystalline forms
of limestone. Over centuries, this process of evaporation and deposition
has built a myriad of crystalline stalactites of all shapes and sizes. Water
that dripped to the floor evaporated and deposited the calcite and aragonite
to build stalagmites. When joined together, stalactites and stalagmites become
columns, or pillars. In the scenic rooms, conditions existed that
brought about the creation of helictites&mdash;twisted formations that seem
to defy gravity in their growth. Color in the cave formations, shades of
brown, red, and yellow, result from the presence of small amounts of iron
oxide and other minerals.</p>
<p>Carlsbad Caverns National Park offers more than the caverns themselves.
Each evening from April to October, bats in incredible numbers
spiral upward out of the Caverns&rsquo; entrance and fly southward over the rim
of the escarpment to feed in the valleys of the Black and Pecos rivers.
They return just before dawn, diving swiftly and from high altitudes into
the entrance. Flying directly to the bat cave, they spend each day hanging
head downward in dense clusters from the walls and ceilings. The bat
cave itself is not open to visitors. A park naturalist explains the bat flight
and discusses the bats in detail in a talk given at the entrance to the
Caverns each evening before the flight begins.</p>
<p>The nature trail, a half mile loop that begins and ends near the entrance
to the Caverns, guides the visitor to many of the desert plants of the
region. The park is visited by more than half a million people each year,
and yet the delicate cave formations and the natural beauties remain
unmarred.</p>
<h4>White Sands National Monument</h4>
<p>White Sands National Monument, fifteen miles southwest of Alamogordo,
is another area of great interest to the geologist and biologist. But
its strangeness, the graceful contours of its snow-white dunes, and the
peculiar adaptations of some of the plants and animals that live among its
dunes are appreciated as fully by the nonscientist. More than 370,000
visitors come to marvel at the White Sands each year.</p>
<p>The Monument, some 230 square miles in extent, preserves the most
impressive part of the world&rsquo;s largest gypsum desert. This is a glistening
sea of pure gypsum sand that the wind has drifted into huge dunes that
are almost bare of vegetation except along the fringes. Wavelike, the
restive dunes move slowly before the prevailing winds, covering and uncovering
the few plants that lie in their way. And wavelike, their surfaces
trace the vagaries of indecisive breezes in tiny parallel ripplelike ridges.</p>
<p>Because of the almost constant wind and resulting gradual advance of
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
the dunes, most of the plants that are able to establish themselves in the
open flats between the dunes eventually become buried. A few species,
however, are able to survive the irresistible march of the sand. Through
rapid growth and elongation of the stems, the struggling crowns remain
on top of the rising crests of the dunes. Plants with stems more than
forty feet long have been found. As the dunes continue forward under the
pressure of the wind, they leave the plants elevated on columns of compacted
gypsum bound by their adventitious roots.</p>
<p>Animals, too, have become adapted to their unusual surroundings. The
small creatures, lizards, mice, and others, are picked off easily by such
predators as foxes, coyotes, and hawks when they are conspicuous. Thus,
through the centuries, only the lighter-colored individuals have survived
among the dunes and, through many generations, have developed pale
and elusive animals that blend inconspicuously with their white surroundings.
Pocket mice are a good example of this. Among the white dunes, the
pocket mice are white; in the nearby red hills, they are a rusty color; and
on the beds of black lava a few miles north of the sand, the pocket mice
are very dark.</p>
<p>A visitor to White Sands National Monument should stop at the
visitor center, where exhibits explain the geology of the duneland and
others describe the plants and animals that are able to live there.</p>
<p>But how and from where did this natural wonder come? The dunes of
gypsum lie in the Tularosa Basin, which stretches for more than 100 miles
between two north-south mountain ranges. All sides of the valley slope
gently inward, forming the basin, with Lake Lucero, its lowest point, at
the southwest end of the Monument. This valley was formed hundreds
of centuries ago, when a great section of the earth&rsquo;s crust settled to form
the type of basin known geologically as a graben.</p>
<p>High above the basin floor, beds of gypsum are found to the north
in the mountain ranges flanking the valley. Similar gypsum beds lie far
beneath the floor of the basin. Thus, it was once a part of the high plateau,
a great blocklike section that slowly sank to form the basin at its present
level.</p>
<p>Percolating water from seasonal rains and melting snow carries tons
of gypsum, in solution, from the highlands at the north end of the basin
into Lake Lucero. During much of the year, cloudless skies and warm
dry winds evaporate Lake Lucero, and it shrinks to a crystal-encrusted
marsh. Capillarity draws the gypsum-laden underground water to the surface;
it, too, evaporates, depositing its burden of gypsum throughout the
extensive &ldquo;alkali flats.&rdquo; The persistent southwest wind picks up the particles
of gypsum and whirls them away, adding them to the gleaming white
dunes, the accumulation of centuries.</p>
<p>The best ways to see the dunes are by car and by foot. Along the drive
that leads into the heart of the duneland are numbered posts that correspond
to numbered paragraphs in the Monument&rsquo;s informational folder.
These paragraphs explain the features that are of particular significance.
At pull-outs along the drive, park the car and walk among the dunes.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Capulin Mountain National Monument</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h4>Capulin Mountain National Monument</h4>
<p>Capulin Mountain National Monument, in the northeast part of the
state, is an area of geologic interest that presents still another aspect of the
science of the earth. It contains the cone of an extinct volcano, one of
the most symmetrical of the geologically recent cinder cones in the United
States. Its conical form rises more than 1000 feet above its base. The irregular
rim is about one mile in circumference, and the crater is about
415 feet in depth, as measured from the highest part of the rim. Some
40,000 people a year visit the Monument.</p>
<p>The mountain consists chiefly of loose cinders, ash, and other rock
debris of volcanic explosions. These materials were spewed out by a series
of successive eruptions, probably of considerable duration. The coarse
materials fell back around the vent, piling up to form the conical mound.
Dust and other fine materials were carried away by the wind. After the
eruptions, vegetation gained a foothold on the steep, unstable flanks of
the cone, so that in time the slopes became stabilized. Geological studies
indicate that the volcano probably was active about 7000 years ago.</p>
<p>Capulin Mountain is of special interest, partly because it represents the
last stages of a great period of volcanic activity that was widespread
throughout western North America. Evidences of this older and more
intense activity can be seen from the top of Capulin Mountain in the
scores of other nearby volcanic hills and peaks. The largest of these is the
Sierra Grande, an extinct volcano rising 4000 feet above the surrounding
plain; it is ten miles to the southeast. Northwest of Capulin are a number
of mesas that are capped with black lava, the largest of which are Barella,
Raton, and Johnson. Fishers Peak, south of Trinidad, Colorado, is on a
similar mesa. The famous Spanish Peaks, northwest of Trinidad, are a
pair of extinct volcanoes.</p>
<p>In this great volcanic area, the lava erupted in a succession of flows.
The series of eruptions were separated by long periods of inactivity. During
these inactive times, erosion cut valleys and wore down parts of the
old lava sheets. This action formed new channels and lower terrain over
which succeeding lava flows spread. This process was repeated at least
three times. The oldest lavas, which have been exposed by erosion, are
found on the tops of the highest mesas. The last series of eruptions created
Capulin Mountain; they were ejections mostly of cinders and ash, with
less lava flow than in the preceding volcanic activity. These cinder-and-ash
eruptions were so recent, geologically, that some of the nearby, bare,
steep-sided cinder cones appear as if they had just cooled.</p>
<p>The National Park Service has constructed a road up the mountain
to the rim of the crater. And from the parking area at the rim, two trails
lead to the most interesting points on the mountain. One trail, self-guiding,
makes the complete one-mile circuit of the crater along the rim. A guide
booklet, keyed to numbered stakes that have been set at places along the
trail, explains the features of particular significance&mdash;both on the mountain
and in the distance. The other trail, less scenic, provides a rare opportunity
to see a volcanic mountain from the inside out, for it leads
down to the bottom of the crater.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">View of Chaco Canyon National Monument</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h4>Chaco Canyon National Monument</h4>
<p>Rich in areas of geological interest, New Mexico is equally rich in areas
of archeological interest. Four of these are preserved as units of the National
Park System.</p>
<p>Chaco Canyon National Monument, in the northwestern part of the
state, contains more than a dozen large prehistoric ruins and hundreds
of smaller archeological sites. These ruins are considered to be without
equal north of central Mexico. No other archeological area in the Southwest
exhibits such a high development of prehistoric Pueblo civilization.
Most of the sites lie within a strip of land about eight miles long and two
miles wide, through which Chaco Canyon runs. Although the Monument
is relatively isolated, it is open year around and is visited by about 22,000
people annually.</p>
<p>The most imposing and best known of the ruins is Pueblo Bonito. Built
between 800 and 900 years ago, this 4- and 5-story village covered more
than three acres and contained about 800 rooms and 32 kivas, or ceremonial
chambers. Archeologist Neil M. Judd, of the National Museum,
who conducted some of the late excavations, has said that Pueblo Bonito
was the largest apartment house built anywhere in the world prior to 1887,
estimating that at one time it housed 1200 people.</p>
<p>Earliest of the Chaco sites, small villages of crude pit houses were
occupied during 600 to 800 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Archeologists, studying changes in masonry
style, pottery types, and other remains, have pieced together the
development of the culture of the inhabitants of Chaco Canyon over a
period of six centuries.</p>
<p>After Chaco Canyon&rsquo;s cultural high point was reached in the 1100&rsquo;s,
a gradual decline set in. The population decreased, and in the 1200&rsquo;s, the
region was abandoned. During this same century, other Pueblo centers
within the San Juan Basin were also deserted.</p>
<p>Various theories have been advanced to explain this exodus: soil erosion,
warlike enemies, poor facilities for urban sanitation, drought, and
intervillage warfare. One or a combination of these factors might have been
instrumental in bringing about the abandonment of the region.</p>
<h4>Aztec Ruins National Monument</h4>
<p>Aztec Ruins National Monument, at Aztec in the northwestern corner
of the state, was set aside to preserve an outstanding example of classical
Pueblo construction, one of the largest pre-Spanish villages in the Southwest.
More than 40,000 visitors come to the Monument each year.</p>
<p>Tree-ring dates indicate that most of the big central pueblo was rapidly
constructed during the period 1106 to 1121. At this time, the people of
Aztec were influenced by the cultural center to the south, Chaco Canyon.
During the last half of the 1100&rsquo;s, after the decline of Chaco Canyon had
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
begun, the people of Aztec began to look toward the north, and by 1200,
Mesa Verde ideas dominated the region. Aztec was abandoned by about
1300, as was the rest of the general region.</p>
<p>Of particular interest at Aztec Ruins National Monument is the reconstructed
Great Kiva. The Pueblo Indians built separate rooms, now
known as kivas, for ceremonial purposes. During the period of Chaco
influence, the people at Aztec constructed a very large circular building,
48 feet in diameter, in their plaza. Its features differ from those of the small
kivas and establish it as a Great Kiva, similar to those at Chaco. The Great
Kivas represent the peak of religious architecture among the Pueblos. The
Great Kiva at Aztec was completely restored in 1934 by Earl H. Morris, of
the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
<h4>Bandelier National Monument</h4>
<p>Bandelier National Monument, forty-six miles west of Santa Fe, preserves
the ruins of dwellings and other structures that were erected by
Indians who lived in the area until about 1550 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Almost 100,000 people
visit the Monument each year.</p>
<p>When many of the ancient Pueblo Indian centers were abandoned
in the late thirteenth century, the people moved to locations where the
water supply was more constant. A favorable area was the upper Rio
Grande Valley in what is now New Mexico. One of the later flowerings
of Pueblo culture occurred here. The ruins within Bandelier are representative
of this phase of Pueblo development.</p>
<p>In Frijoles Canyon, the Indians chose the location of their homes
well. The creek that runs through the canyon flows all year. On the canyon
floor and mesa top there was land suitable to the cultivation of crops.
And the canyon walls of soft tuff (consolidated volcanic ash) could easily
be hollowed out by the Indians with their harder stone tools in fashioning
storage rooms behind dwellings built against the cliff.</p>
<p>Cliff ruins, or talus villages, extend along the base of the northern
wall of the canyon for about two miles. Other ruins are located on the
floor of the canyon. The houses of stone masonry were irregularly terraced,
from one to three stories in height. Some hollowed recesses at the base
of the cliff also were used for dwelling rooms.</p>
<p>Like the other pueblo dwellers, the Frijoles inhabitants were farmers,
raising the usual corn, beans, and squash. They used cotton cloth, which
has been found in the ruins and which suggests that they had the loom.
Since the growing season in the high Frijoles country is short, they probably
obtained their cotton by trade with Indians who lived farther south.
They made pottery decorated with glaze paint.</p>
<p>For a few centuries, the Indian farmers lived in the canyons, built villages,
honeycombed the cliffs with artificial caves, and tilled the soil.
But with the passing years, drought, soil-eroding floods, soil depletion,
famine, and possibly disease&mdash;singly or in combination&mdash;forced the canyon
dwellers again to seek new homes. Descendants of these Indians still live
in nearby modern pueblos along the Rio Grande.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Cliff houses in Frijoles Canyon, Bandelier National Monument</span></p>
</div>
<p>About ninety per cent of Bandelier National Monument is, and will
remain, a wilderness. The rugged and scenic back country is accessible by
about sixty miles of maintained trails, leading to such features as Alamo
Canyon, the Stone Lions, Painted Cave, the Pueblo ruins of San Miguel
and Yapashi, and White Rock Canyon of the Rio Grande.</p>
<h4>Valle Grande</h4>
<p>Another area has been considered as an addition to the National Park
System in New Mexico. A 1963 bill introduced in Congress would establish
Valle Grande-Bandelier National Park, about forty-six miles west of
Santa Fe. Valle Grande is part of the Valle Caldera, which is among the
world&rsquo;s largest and has been the site of extensive studies of calderas (the
collapsed summits of volcanoes). Lessons learned there have been applied in
recognizing and investigating calderas in other places. Bandelier National
Monument, primarily of archeological significance, lies to the east of the
canyon-cut rim of the caldera. As written, the bill would have incorporated
the Monument in the proposed national park.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Part of Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h4>Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument</h4>
<p>Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument, forty-seven miles north of
Silver City and at the edge of the Gila Wilderness Area, contains a series
of ruins that portray the development of the agricultural Indians who lived
south of the Mogollon Mountains. Specifically, the ruins represent a
branch of the generalized culture known as Mogollon. Although part of
the road to the Monument was paved in 1963, the last four-mile stretch is
still primitive and should not be attempted in an ordinary passenger car
except during the summer and in dry weather. In spite of the difficult road,
more than 23,000 people visited the Monument during 1965. The last
four miles of the road have been recently paved.</p>
<p>The earliest ruin yet found within the Monument is a Mogollon pit
house of a type that was made about 500 <span class="small">A.D.</span> It is roundish and, on the
east side, has a narrow ramplike entrance some two feet wide and ten feet
long. The people of this period did only a little farming (corn and beans),
a little hunting, and gathered much uncultivated plant food. They made
a fairly good plain-brown pottery and undoubtedly were skilled in a number
of crafts whose products have since disappeared. Such things as nets
and snares, baskets, and wooden tools last but a short time in open sites.</p>
<p>Other, later, pit house types may be seen in the Monument. Pit
houses were prevalent in the area until about 1000 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, when influences
from the Anasazi (Pueblo) Indians of the northern part of the Southwest
began to affect the Mogollon people.</p>
<p>Square houses, built above the ground, became the style; some were
of masonry, some of adobe construction, and some were built of wattle
(wooden rods and twigs). A new type of pottery was also introduced at
about the same time: white with black designs.</p>
<p>The principal ruins in the Monument are the cliff dwellings, which
were built during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They, too, reflect
the northern pueblo influence. About forty rooms, remarkably well
preserved, are fitted into a series of chambers, or caves, in a low cliff of
Gila Conglomerate. By about the beginning of the fifteenth century, the
area was abandoned by the farming Indians.</p>
<h4>Gran Quivira National Monument</h4>
<p>Significant chapters in the absorbing history of New Mexico were
written at three sites that have been made units of the National Park
System.</p>
<p>Gran Quivira National Monument, near the center of the state southeast
of Mountainair, preserves the ruins of a frontier Spanish mission that
had been built, used, and abandoned by 1675. The Monument contains
twenty-one ruined house mounds of Indian pueblos and ruins of two mission
churches. It was the presence of the Indians at this location, of course,
that attracted the Franciscan missionaries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">A look at ruins of Gran Quivira</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The earliest Indian pueblo in the Monument was founded about 1300
<span class="small">A.D.</span>; by the 1600&rsquo;s, the village, with several structures, had become the
largest in the region. It was conveniently located on the south side of a
hill near the cultivated fields in the surrounding lowlands. Water was a
problem then as now. The Indians solved this as best they could by digging
shallow wells at the base of the hill, about one mile west of the
pueblo.</p>
<p>The first known specific reference to Gran Quivira was made in 1630
by Fray Alonso de Benavides, a Franciscan missionary. He called the
pueblo the &ldquo;Village of the Humanas,&rdquo; and referred to the church there as
having been built by Father Francisco Letrado in 1629 and dedicated to
San Isidro. Humanas, now misnamed &ldquo;Gran Quivira,&rdquo; was later administered
from the mission of San Gregorio de Abo, some forty miles to the
north. In 1659, Father Diego de Santander was assigned to Humanas.
Construction of the mission buildings, which he rededicated to San
Buenaventura, was completed by him.</p>
<p>The Franciscans had a pronounced influence upon the Pueblo Indians.
They stimulated trade with Mexico and the pueblos farther north.
They imported wine grapes and cultivated them, and they introduced
domesticated sheep, goats, cattle, and horses.</p>
<p>Sometime between 1672 and 1675, the pueblo and mission at Humanas
were abandoned because of Apache raids, drought, and crop failures. The
people first moved to the Rio Grande near the present town of Socorro. A
few continued to El Paso del Norte, where, in 1680, they were joined
by those from Socorro, who had fled with the Spaniards from the Pueblo
Revolt of that year.</p>
<h4>El Morro National Monument</h4>
<p>El Morro National Monument, southwest of Grants near Ramah, was
established to preserve the famous Inscription Rock, register of Indians,
Spaniards, and westward-moving pioneers. About 22,000 people now visit
the Monument each year.</p>
<p>El Morro, or Inscription Rock, is a massive mesa point of sandstone.
Rising some 200 feet above the valley floor, it forms a striking landmark.
From its summit, rain and melted snow drain into a natural basin at the
foot of the cliff, creating a constant and dependable supply of water in
a region where water is scarce. The route from Acoma to the Zuni pueblos
led directly past the mesa. It was a regular camping place for Spanish
<i>conquistadores</i> and, later, for travelers from the east.</p>
<p>On the top of El Morro lie ruins of Indian pueblos, abandoned long
before the coming of the Spaniards. And carved in the sandstone are
numerous petroglyphs left by these ancient people, ancestors of the modern
Zunis. Perhaps it was the petroglyphs that prompted later travelers to
record their names and thoughts on the rock.</p>
<p>The first known historical mention of El Morro is found in the journal
of Diego P&eacute;rez de Lux&aacute;n, chronicler of the Espejo Expedition of 1583.
Lux&aacute;n stopped there for water on March 11 of that year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Part of the pool and cliff at El Morro</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The oldest dated inscription at El Morro was made in 1605 by don
Juan de O&ntilde;ate, first governor of New Mexico. Returning from an expedition
to the mouth of the Colorado River, he camped at El Morro and
carved this inscription in Spanish: &ldquo;Passed by here the Adelantado Don
Juan de O&ntilde;ate from the discovery of the Sea of the South, the 16th of
April of 1605.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Sea of the South&rdquo; was the Gulf of California.</p>
<p>If don Diego de Vargas, the most famous Spanish governor of New
Mexico, seems boastful in the message he left at El Morro, who can blame
him? His words, in English, read, &ldquo;Here was the General Don Diego de
Vargas, who conquered for our Holy Faith and for the Royal Crown
all of New Mexico at his own expense, year of 1692.&rdquo; Twelve years earlier,
the great Pueblo Indian Revolt had driven the Spaniards from New
Mexico. More than 400, including 23 priests, had lost their lives, and
the surviving Spaniards, some 1100, had fled to El Paso del Norte. De
Vargas restored order, without further bloodshed, in 1692.</p>
<p>After the occupation of Santa Fe by the army of Gen. Stephen W.
Kearny in August 1846, details of United States troops were dispatched to
explore various parts of New Mexico. Probably the first to visit El Morro
was Lt. J. H. Simpson, accompanied by the artist R. H. Kern, who copied
some of the early inscriptions in September 1849. Then the names of
other soldiers, traders, Indian agents, surveyors, emigrants who were
traveling westward, and settlers were added to the rock.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Monument by Presidential proclamation
in 1906, inscribing on the face of the cliff has been prohibited. If the
Monument had not been established and the law not passed, this fascinating
part of the history of the Southwest would surely have been lost.</p>
<h4>Fort Union National Monument</h4>
<p>Fort Union National Monument, twenty-six miles northeast of Las
Vegas and on the route of the old Santa Fe Trail where the mountains
meet the plains, preserves the ruins of a famous frontier Army post. As
a base of operations for military and civilian ventures in New Mexico
from 1851 to 1891, Fort Union helped to direct the course of events in
the formative years of the Southwest. More than 11,000 visitors come to
the Monument each year.</p>
<p>Five years after the conquest of New Mexico by the United States in
the war with Mexico, Col. E. V. Sumner moved some of his troops from
Fort Marcy, in Santa Fe, to the site of Fort Union and there began
construction of log buildings on the west side of Coyote Creek. This was
the first Fort Union.</p>
<p>The first post took an active part in protecting settlers and traders
from Indian raids during the 1850&rsquo;s. Mounted patrols of dragoons made
many expeditions into the mountains against the warring Apaches and
Utes and out onto the plains to pursue Comanche war parties.</p>
<p>Fort Union was also charged with supply and support of many outlying
military posts, such as Fort Defiance and Fort Craig. The Quartermaster
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
Depot at Fort Union in later years came to be the hub of all Army
supply services in the Southwest.</p>
<p>During the first three decades of its life, Fort Union saw the great
Conestoga wagons and prairie schooners of the Santa Fe Trail caravans
pass in increasing numbers. By the outbreak of the Civil War, enterprising
traders were hauling more than ten million dollars&rsquo; worth of goods
from Missouri each year. The fort provided escorts for caravans and when
requested by apprehensive company or postal officials, escorts for stage-coaches
of the Independence-Santa Fe Mail. Century-old tracks of the
Santa Fe Trail can be still seen near Fort Union.</p>
<p>The start of the Civil War in 1861 brought new activity to the fort. Immediate
invasion of New Mexico by Confederate forces from Texas was
expected. Gen. E. R. S. Canby, commanding Union troops in the territory,
began construction of an earthwork fortification in a defensive position
about a mile from the original fort. The ditches, parapets, and bomb-proofs
of this redoubt were completed late in 1861.</p>
<p>The Texas column was not slow in coming. By March 1862, these
invaders under Gen. Henry H. Sibley had defeated a Union force at
Val Verde, had frightened the defenders from Albuquerque and Santa
Fe into inaction, and were marching eastward across the mountains toward
the final stronghold, Fort Union. On March 10, the First Regiment of
Colorado Volunteers, under Col. J. P. Slough, arrived at Fort Union as
reinforcements. And on March 22, Colonel Slough led his 1342 men out
of the fort to meet the advancing Confederates. In a two-day battle fought
in Apache Canyon and Glorieta Pass, the Union forces defeated the
Confederates, thus saving Fort Union for the federal cause.</p>
<p>From 1863 to 1869, the garrisons at Fort Union were chiefly occupied
in a construction program that produced most of the adobe-walled buildings
whose ruins may now be seen. Fort Union then returned to its earlier
mission of a base for Indian fighting.</p>
<p>The usefulness of Fort Union was reduced with the final submission
of the Indians and with the arrival of the railhead at Las Vegas in 1879.
The huge fort was demoted to caretaker status in the 1880&rsquo;s and was abandoned
in 1891.</p>
<p class="tb">At each of these New Mexico units of the National Park System, as
at other units throughout the nation, trained personnel of the National
Park Service&mdash;archeologists, historians, naturalists, and park rangers&mdash;are
on duty. Their purpose is to make the visitor&rsquo;s trip rewarding. This they do
through museum exhibits, guided walks and self-guiding trails, campfire
talks, and publications.</p>
<p>Here in New Mexico, then, escape the irritations that seem to go
with progress. Awaiting the traveler are unspoiled places where he can surround
himself with the quiet majesty of nature, walk the paths made
by prehistoric people, camp where the Spanish <i>conquistadores</i> camped,
stroll among the ruins of buildings erected by the men who helped to
fashion the Southwest.</p>

<h3 id="c9">FOREST LANDS ABOVE THE DESERT</h3>
<p class="center">by <span class="sc">Ruth Bush Jones</span><a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Today, as in earlier times, people of New Mexico look to their mountains
with a new and greater appreciation of their forest land heritage.
Today, also, people seek aesthetic values of peace, beauty, and serenity
found in nature&rsquo;s solitudes, in addition to forest products for economic use.
Basic to the enjoyment of the high country are the forest treasures of
clear, pure water ... of wild game and birds ... of trees for shade
and solitude, fuel, shelter, and forest products ... of grass and browse
for cattle, sheep, horses, and wildlife ... of magnificent grandeur and
panoramic vistas. These basic treasures coupled with understanding of
the purposes and many benefits of the National Forests bring true recreation
to the visitor.</p>
<p>The high country of New Mexico, much of it in the National Forests, is
entrusted by law to the care and administration of the U.S. Forest Service,
an agency of the Department of Agriculture. These vast public properties
located in several sections of the state are administered as Carson, Santa
Fe, Cibola, Lincoln, Gila, Apache, and Coronado National Forests, the
latter two lying primarily in Arizona and being directed from there rather
than from New Mexico. Visitors to New Mexico traveling along main
highways see the high forest country outlining the horizon and often
regard the lofty masses of rugged rock as unapproachable and lacking in
friendliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; says the Forest Ranger. There are broad highways welcoming
the traveler into the high country where forest trees stretch to the sky.
There are cool invigorating streams sparkling clear and clean from mountain
fastnesses and developed campgrounds and picnic areas ready for use.
Outdoor recreation from simple relaxing and picnicking under a pine tree
to the most strenuous of wilderness backpacking or horseback riding,
winter sports, and skiing awaits the visitor. There is fishing in mountain
streams and in big open lakes or in precious, secluded mountain lakes.
And for those who like their surroundings interpreted for them, there
are nature trails and/or forest naturalists to explain local rock formations,
vegetation, and the natural and human history of the immediate country.</p>
<p>The Forest Ranger asks only that each visitor do his share in cleaning
up a camp or picnic site and being <i>sure</i> that camp fires, matches, and
cigarettes are thoroughly extinguished: &ldquo;Keep Your National Forest Green
and Clean!&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Carson National Forest</h4>
<p>Located in north-central New Mexico, with headquarters at Taos, the
Carson National Forest nurtures and cradles the Rio Grande as it leaves
its birthplace in Colorado en route to the south. Carrying water from
high country snow melt, the Carson adds precious, clear water from its
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
high mountain streams and lakes to the Rio Grande in support of the prosperous
communities along its way. The Carson includes some of the highest
water-producing lands in the state and is the source of several permanent
streams and lakes.</p>

<p>Named in honor of Kit Carson, the noted scout, Carson National
Forest offers some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in the Southwest,
including the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Red River Canyon, and
Wheeler Peak, which at 13,160 feet is the highest point in New Mexico.
Part of the famed Pecos Wilderness Area and the Wheeler Peak Wild
Area are included in this Forest and are available to those willing and able
to hike, ride a horse, or pack into the rugged mountain country. For the
winter sports enthusiast, the Red River Ski Area, Sipapu Winter Sports
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
Area, and Taos Ski Valley operate in part within the Carson National
Forest and offer some of the finest alpine skiing in the Southwest.</p>
<p>Good roads lead the visitor to Spanish and Indian villages where life
and culture are almost unchanged since the ancient and comparatively
recent days of settlement. Towns with singing-sounding names like Picur&iacute;s,
Taos Pueblo, Las Trampas, Truchas, Santa Barbara, and Tres Ritos nestle
along forest streams and add charm and beauty to a scenic trip in the northern
Sangre de Cristo range (name given to the mountains by early Spanish
settlers, meaning <i>Blood of Christ</i>. The analogy relates to the reddish glow
that sometimes colors the mountains at sunset.). Radiating from Taos are
roads leading into the eastern half of the Forest, bringing the traveler
into fascinating and colorful country. Taos Canyon, Arroyo Hondo,
Questa, and the Red River country abound in old mining ghost towns,
Indian ruins, and legendary Spanish villages located in canyons and on
mountain tops.</p>
<p>The high range rising between the Rio Grande and the Chama River
to the west is the major part of the western half of the Carson National
Forest. Tres Piedras, El Rito, La Madera, Canjilon, Lagunitas, and San
Antonio are a few of the picturesque communities here. Farther to the west
is the Jicarilla Division of the Carson, the high mountain country adjacent
to the Jicarilla Apache Reservation. Bisected by State Highway 17 between
Farmington and Chama, this section is a test of true pioneering skill for the
traveler who is willing to follow dim tracks of roads and trails to enjoy
the Forest. However, modern civilization is introduced by the 150 oil and
gas wells in this area, even though the country is rugged and broken.</p>
<p>Carson National Forest is a trout fisherman&rsquo;s delight. For the hunter,
Rocky Mountain mule deer, elk, and antelope are found in all parts of
the Forest. Small game is plentiful, and rabbits provide many hours of
hunting pleasure. Beaver, muskrat, mink, weasel, marten, and skunk are
the principal fur bearers, and turkey, grouse, ducks, geese, quail, and doves
make up the game bird population. Predators include the mountain lion,
bobcat, coyote, and fox.</p>
<p>More than 40 developed camp and picnic grounds, most of which are
accessible year round, welcome the visitor. Among them, Echo Amphitheater
picnic ground on U.S. Highway 84, south of Canjilon, is a striking
natural echo chamber formed by centuries of wind and water erosion in
the rugged sandstone rock. &ldquo;If you stand near the chamber, you only have
to whisper, and your words come back in a spooky echo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About five miles south on U.S. Highway 84 is the Ghost Ranch Museum,
with live native Southwestern animals and conservation exhibits,
including a living and growing display showing on-the-ground Forest Service
Multiple Use Management of the mythical Beaver National Forest,
the &ldquo;smallest National Forest in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ranger stations at Canjilon, El Rito, Gobernador, Penasco, Questa,
Taos, and Tres Piedras provide local information and recreation maps.</p>

<h4>Santa Fe National Forest</h4>
<p>The Santa Fe National Forest, with headquarters in Santa Fe, lies
directly south of the Carson National Forest on both sides of the Rio
Grande and is the center of a region rich in natural resources as well as
historic and geologic interests. The two divisions of the Forest contain the
high mountains to the east and west in the central section of the state.
The Pecos Division to the east of the Rio Grande is the location of the
major part of the Pecos Wilderness Area, one of the earliest of such areas
to be established.</p>
<p>The Pecos Division is so named because the Pecos River, which later
joins the Rio Grande in Texas, heads among its towering mountains in a
beautiful alpine basin sometimes called the <i>Pecos Horseshoe</i>. The Pecos
River is one of the state&rsquo;s largest streams and supplies some of its most
important irrigation projects. This division of the Forest includes the
southern part of the Sangre de Cristo range and was first known as the
Pecos River Forest Reserve, established in 1892&mdash;the oldest National Forest
in the Southwest. The division abounds in clear, cold mountain lakes and
streams. Truchas Lakes, Pecos Baldy, Stewart Lake, Spirit Lake, and Lost
Lake, as well as many mountain streams, lure not only the fisherman but
the hiker and camper to their wilderness beauty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Twenty-three developed campgrounds and picnic areas located in cool
glades are ready for the visitor along roads leading into the Forest from
Santa Fe, Pecos, Glorieta, Las Vegas, and other communities. Skiing and
winter sports are available at the Santa Fe Ski Basin northeast of Santa
Fe; the chair lift operates year around for those who wish merely to view
the spectacular scenery. The Pecos Division watersheds of the Santa Fe
National Forest, like the eastern section of the Carson, contribute generously
to the water flow of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Wild game, game birds, and fishing attract visitors at all times of the
year, while the golden hues of the aspen in the autumn tempt artists and
photographers to record on canvas and film nature&rsquo;s fall colors. A trip just
before the winter snows to the aspen country of the Santa Fe National
Forest is a must. Ranger stations are located at Santa Fe, Las Vegas, and
Pecos.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">An Izaak Walton along the Pecos river</span></p>
</div>
<p>West of the Rio Grande are the Jemez Mountains, which form the
Jemez Division of the Santa Fe National Forest. The Jemez country is a
favorite area for fishermen and hunters. For the sturdy hiker and picnicker,
there are hundreds of fascinating points to visit and peaks to climb. Capulin
Peak, Dead Man&rsquo;s Peak, Nacimiento Peak, and Cerro Pedernal are a few
of the exciting ones. The Jemez country contains the San Pedro Parks
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
Wild Area, northeast of Cuba where San Gregorio Lake is waiting for
the fisherman or hiker willing to walk or ride horseback. This section
abounds in unique geologic formations&mdash;Battleship Rock, Tent Rocks, Teakettle
Rock, to name a few.</p>
<p>Eighteen developed camping and picnicking areas welcome the visitor
to the Jemez Division. Youth groups also favor the Jemez for their summer
camping. Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, YMCA, and
others have camps adjacent to the Santa Fe National Forest. Timber production,
wildlife habitat management, livestock grazing, and watershed
protection are among the activities of the Jemez Division, while visitors
and travelers enjoy the forest, the streams, and the unique scenery. Ranger
stations are at Jemez Springs, Cuba, Espanola, and Coyote.</p>
<h4>Cibola National Forest</h4>
<p>A mountain playground for people who live or visit near U.S. Highway
66 is Cibola National Forest, with headquarters in Albuquerque. Embracing
the Sandias, Manzanos, and Gallinas Peak areas east of the Rio Grande
in central New Mexico, this Forest also includes most of the mountain
ranges in the west-central section of the state, the San Mateo Mountains,
with 11,389-foot Mount Taylor, and the Datil, Magdalena, and Zuni
ranges.</p>
<p>Outdoor recreation is the fastest growing use of the Cibola National
Forest and more than a million visits are made each year to this popular
Forest. The name is a Zuni Indian word, pronounced SEE-bo-lah, meaning
<i>buffalo</i>. Buffalo may have roamed the Cibola in years past, but today&rsquo;s
big game animals making the Cibola their home are the Rocky Mountain
bighorn sheep, Rocky Mountain mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, antelope,
and bear. Game birds include turkey, grouse, quail, and dove; spring
and fall migrations of ducks and geese use the Cibola as a resting place.
There are 18 campgrounds with 249 family units and 14 picnic grounds
with 382 family units scattered through the vast domain of the Cibola National
Forest.</p>
<p>Sandia Crest in the Sandia Mountains east of Albuquerque is a goal
for many travelers. Here on this 10,678-foot mountain top, there is a
breathtaking view of the middle Rio Grande Valley and the Estancia
Valley&mdash;a jet age view of nearly 10,000 square miles. The visitor stands
on rocks which in eons past were under the sea, as indicated by fossils
found on the peak. Recent recreation developments have been made at
the Sandia Ski Area where a new 7450-foot double chair lift will carry
700 riders an hour on a 1650-foot vertical rise to the restaurant and upper
terminal on Sandia Crest. A tramway ascends the west face of the Sandias
to meet the Ski Area chair lift at the Crest.</p>
<p>The fabled Manzano Mountains rising above the plains to the west of
State Highway 10 and south of U.S. Highway 66 are fast becoming a
haven for the camper, picnicker, or sightseer willing to follow secondary
roads to find the perfect spot to enjoy the forest. Capillo Peak, 9368 feet
high, Mosca Peak, Cerro Blanco, and Manzano Peak lure the mountain
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
climber. Legends surrounding the old Spanish communities of Tajique,
Torreon, and Manzano are exciting campfire stories after a day spent exploring
the high country.</p>
<p>West of the Rio Grande, the San Mateo Mountains north of Grants
and the Zuni Mountains forming the backbone of the Continental Divide
southeast of Gallup can be a new experience in outdoor recreation. McGaffey
Lake recreation area, not too far from the route of the <i>conquistadore</i>
Juan de O&ntilde;ate, is a cool retreat after crossing the desert and lava
flow.</p>
<p>West of Socorro on U.S. Highway 60, with Magdalena as headquarters,
the high Datil, Gallinas, and Magdalena mountains and another
San Mateo range rise above the San Agustin Plains, an ancient lake bed.
Mt. Withington and Mt. Baldy, 10,787 feet high, dominate the landscape.
Good roads and developed campgrounds are available. Hunting for wild
game as well as for unusual gem stones and geologic finds are favored
activities in this western section of the Cibola. District ranger stations
are at Grants, Gallup, Magdalena, Mountainair, and Tijeras.</p>
<h4>Lincoln National Forest</h4>
<p>Named for the great president, the Lincoln National Forest, with headquarters
at Alamogordo, has characteristics distinguishing it from all other
National Forests in the state. The high mountains and canyons of the
Sacramento, Guadalupe, Capitan, and White mountains, rising between
the Tularosa and Pecos basins, were the backdrop and often the prize
of the Indian and cattle wars. Stories and legends of early day happenings
in the Tularosa Basin, mining operations, battles between rival cattle
ranchers, large timber operations providing lumber, poles, mine props, and
railroad ties are warp and woof of the Lincoln country. This Forest includes
the high mountains north and south of the Mescalero Apache
Indian Reservation.</p>
<p>During the last decade, the Lincoln National Forest gained new
fame as the birthplace of the world-renowned Smokey the Bear, symbol of
forest fire prevention. In the Capitan Mountains, travelers like to visit
Smokey&rsquo;s birthplace near Capitan Pass, and in the community of Capitan
on U.S. Highway 380 is a log museum which features the activities of the
bear cub found near there during a disastrous fire.</p>
<p>For the outdoor enthusiast, the Forest offers superb beauty, graceful
and majestic snow-covered peaks, and the peace and serenity of a forest
sanctuary. Each year, thousands of visitors from the plains seek its cool
refuge from desert heat in summer and its readily accessible sports area
in the winter. Ten campgrounds with many picnicking and camping sites
are provided. Canyons, mountains, and streams in many instances feature
anglicized names&mdash;Big Dog Canyon, Mule Peak, Bug Scuffle Hill&mdash;though
the influence of the early Spanish settler still remains in names such as
Sacramento, Agua Chiquita, Ruidoso, and Rio Penasco.</p>
<p>Lincoln National Forest abounds in points of interest; Monjeau Lookout
overlooks the headwaters of the Bonito, Eagle, and Ruidoso creeks as
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
well as the tall slopes of Sierra Blanca to the southwest. Sierra Blanca,
12,003 feet high, is the most southerly mountain of that elevation in the
continental United States. Just north of the peak is the Sierra Blanca
Recreation Area, with one of the finest and best-equipped skiing facilities
in the country. The restaurant and gondola lift operate during summer
months, and from Lookout Mountain observation site, near the gondola&rsquo;s
upper terminal, the traveler can view White Sands, the Malpais (lava
flow), and the 28,000-acre White Mountain Wild Area.</p>
<p>Hunters find deer of three distinct types in this Forest&mdash;the Rocky
Mountain mule deer, the desert mule deer, and the Texas white-tailed
deer&mdash;and, of course, black bear from which family Smokey the Bear came.
Game birds like wild turkey, quail, and chukkar partridge challenge the
hunter. Fishing the Lincoln&rsquo;s lakes and streams is a recurring delight to
the angler. Aspens and oaks flaunt their brilliant autumn coloring against
the warm green of pines and spruces, heralding the advent of winter snows
and provoking numerous aspencades for those who wish a share in this ever
new pageant of nature&rsquo;s beauty.</p>
<p>Like all the National Forests, the Lincoln is managed for the production
and wise use of water, timber, and forage for livestock and wildlife
and outdoor recreation. District ranger stations are at Cloudcroft,
Carlsbad, Mayhill, Ruidoso, Sacramento, and Capitan.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h4>Gila National Forest</h4>
<p>The Gila National Forest, with headquarters in Silver City, is a big,
wild, wonderful country in the southwestern section of the state. It has
been scarcely affected by the hustle and bustle of modern living. Within
its boundaries are 2.7 million acres of public-owned forest and range land,
with almost a quarter of it devoted to wilderness and primitive areas. It
includes the famous Gila Wilderness, the first such area set aside in the
United States and the largest in the Southwest. Most of the Gila National
Forest is north of Silver City, though part of it lies in the high country
between Silver City and Lordsburg.</p>
<p>The Gila is an exciting and exhilarating place to explore, sightsee,
hunt, fish, and just enjoy. Indian ruins are evident almost everywhere, but
the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument, adjacent to the Gila
Primitive Area, is the best preserved. Ancient tree stumps and abandoned
Indian ruins record the history of man; old mine dumps contain ores and
minerals not known nor appreciated in the heyday of local mining; microscopic
plants and forest grasses which may hold the key to man&rsquo;s future
health abound; and the traveler may experience great delight in finding
a dried root or branch to add to a native rock garden; the majestic peaks,
deer and other wild game, and cool, splashing waters of a mountain creek
delight the camera hobbyist.</p>
<p>One of the most beautiful and spectacular box canyons in the Southwest
is on Whitewater Creek about four miles northeast of Glenwood.
A catwalk built against the rock walls of the canyon enables the traveler
to thrill at the unusual beauty and colors of the canyon and the cool
depths of the trout stream below (<i>see</i> <a href="#fig1">Frontispiece</a>).</p>
<p>Good roads lead into the Gila National Forest at Reserve and Alma
from U.S. Highway 260. An enjoyable loop trip which touches the Gila
Wilderness at Willow Creek can be taken on State Highway 78 from
Alma. Another beautiful trip is through the Black Range from the junction
of State Highway 180 and U.S. Highway 85 to Silver City. Approach
to the Gila from the north can be made through Beaverhead, Apache
Creek, and Reserve, where good roads lead into the Forest.</p>
<p>Fifteen developed recreation areas provide camping and picnicking for
the hiker, horseback rider, and motorist and are complete with fireplaces,
tables, and benches. Elk, deer, antelope, bear, javelina, and game birds
are plentiful, and fishing in the high mountain creeks is usually rewarded
with a satisfying catch.</p>
<p>District ranger stations are at Magdalena, Truth or Consequences,
Reserve, Glenwood, and Mimbres.</p>
<h4>Apache and Coronado Forests</h4>
<p>Although small parts of these forests lie in New Mexico, they belong
to forests in Arizona. Apache National Forest touches the northern edge
of the Gila and its attractions are much like those of the latter. The
Coronado National Forest, which is in the extreme southwest corner of
New Mexico, lies in an area of aridity and is difficult to reach from New
Mexico. It is surrounded by Sonoran desert, at least in its environment in
this state.</p>

<p class="tb">These far-flung public lands in New Mexico provide many resources
besides varied kinds of outdoor recreation: timber for industry, water for
city and farm, forage for livestock and wildlife. As long as our National
Forests are protected and developed&mdash;used but not abused&mdash;they will continue
to yield rich harvests, both tangible and intangible, forever.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">The State Also Preserves<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></span></h2>
<p>State Monuments have been established to preserve some of New Mexico&rsquo;s
historic and archeologic sites of importance. These include the mission
ruins of Abo, Quarai, Pecos, and Jemez, the Palace of the Governors in
Santa Fe, pueblo ruins at Coronado State Monument, the old Lincoln
County Courthouse, the archeologic site at Folsom Man State Monument,
the plaza and nearby Mexican Colonial-style buildings in La Mesilla, and
Fort Selden. The history recorded at these sites dates from 10,000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> of
Clovis Man to 1878 of the cattlemen&rsquo;s Lincoln County War.</p>
<p>State parks cover areas of scenic beauty, geologic wonders, and historic
interest. Reservoir lakes yielding necessary water, good fishing, swimming,
and boating include Conchas, Storrie, Bluewater, El Vado, Ute, Elephant
Butte, Caballo, Alamogordo, Clayton, Morphy, and Bottomless Lakes. The
latter are natural sink holes east of Roswell. Hyde Memorial Park and
Santa Fe River Park, near and in Santa Fe, provide scenic picnic spots, as
do Rock Hound State Park near Deming and Oasis State Park near Portales
and Clovis. Picnicking, fishing, and spectacular canyons attract the
visitor at Rio Grande Gorge Park west of Taos. Weird erosional figures
carved from volcanic layers distinguish City of Rocks State Park near
Deming. Pancho Villa State Park at Columbus and Kit Carson Memorial
at Taos mark historic sites. Valley of Fires State Park west of Carrizozo
preserves the black twisted lava of a relatively recent volcanic flow.</p>
<h3 id="c11">NEW MEXICO STATE MONUMENTS</h3>
<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">Museum of New Mexico Staff</span></p>
<p>The State of New Mexico, recognizing the depth and color of its own
history, has established a number of state monuments preserving important
historical or archeological sites. These are administered by the
Museum of New Mexico located in Santa Fe. Any mosaic of New Mexico
would be incomplete without including these important landmarks.</p>
<h4>El Palacio, Palace of the Governors</h4>
<p>The main facility of the Museum of New Mexico is El Palacio. The
Palace of the Governors, on the plaza in the heart of Santa Fe, is the
oldest public building in the United States. Built in 1610, it was the seat
of Spanish government in New Mexico until 1821, of the Mexican government
until 1846, and the residence of the governors appointed by the
President of the United States until 1910, when it became a unit of the
Museum of New Mexico.</p>
<p>It presently contains exhibits relating to New Mexico&rsquo;s past, ranging
from the Indians, who arrived after crossing the Bering Sea, to the Spanish,
who came seeking gold and glory on horseback, to the wagon trains
from the east, whose goal was the end of the Santa Fe Trail, which is
directly in front of El Palacio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>El Palacio was the capitol of New Mexico for 300 years and was the
seat of residence for more than one hundred of New Mexico&rsquo;s governors.
During that time it was captured and held by the Indians from 1680 to
1692. The Army of the Confederacy captured it for a few days during
the Civil War, and one of its occupants, Territorial Governor Lew. Wallace,
wrote his famous novel, <i>Ben Hur</i>, within its walls.</p>
<p>There are other fascinating units connected with the Museum of New
Mexico in Santa Fe. Among these are the Fine Arts Museum, emphasizing
the art and artists of the great Southwest; the International Folk Art
Museum; and the Hall of Ethnology, devoted primarily to the peoples
of the Southwest.</p>
<h4>Abo State Monument</h4>
<p>Off U.S. Highway 60, nine miles west of Mountainair is Abo State
Monument.</p>
<p>The ruins of the ancient mission church of San Gregorio de Abo and
its pueblo, built of red sandstone, are in a broad, natural amphitheater
rimmed on the north and west by the blue Manzano Mountains, which
contrast strikingly with the reddish hues of the Abo sandstone. This is
one of the Saline Missions, so called because of the nearby salt deposits
in the Estancia Basin.</p>
<p>It was built during the seventeenth century by Indians under the
supervision of the Franciscans, led by the venerable Fray Francisco de
Acevedo. The inhabitants of Abo were very friendly to the Spaniards.
They were forced to abandon their pueblo about 1673 because of drought
and the raids of the Apaches and Comanches. They then moved south
to El Paso del Norte where they joined in founding Isleta del Sur.</p>
<p>The walls of the pueblo have disintegrated with time into low mounds
which lie adjacent to the mission. The ecclesiastical structures have been
excavated and repaired for permanent preservation.</p>
<h4>Quarai State Monument</h4>
<p>This monument is near Punta de Agua, eight miles north of Mountainair
off State Highway 10.</p>
<p>The ruins of the mission church of the Immaculate Conception at
Quarai are unsurpassed in grandeur of architecture or setting by any that
survive from the labors of the early Franciscans in New Mexico. Built
of red sandstone masonry about 1628, at the Pueblo of Quarai, it was
abandoned along with the pueblo about 1674, chiefly because of Apache
depredations.</p>
<p>One of the most venerated of the Franciscan missionaries, Fray Geronimo
de la Llana, worked and died at Quarai, beloved by his Indian
charges. His remains now rest in a crypt in the wall of St. Francis Cathedral
in Santa Fe. The ruins have been excavated and repaired for permanent
preservation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h4>Coronado State Monument</h4>
<p>This pueblo ruin is on the west bank of the Rio Grande, one mile from
the town of Bernalillo, seventeen miles north of Albuquerque, and one
mile off U.S. Highway 85, between Albuquerque and Santa Fe.</p>
<p>The Pueblo of Kuaua was one of the several towns of the ancient
Tiguex province. At or near Kuaua, the Coronado expedition maintained
headquarters from about 1540 to 1542 <span class="small">A.D.</span> During excavation of the
ancient pueblo, more than 1200 ground-floor rooms were found and five
kivas, or underground ceremonial chambers, were uncovered.</p>
<p>In one of the kivas was found a highly important group of ancient
wall paintings. This kiva has been reconstructed and the paintings restored.</p>
<p>The old walls of Kuaua have been rebuilt to a few feet in height so
that the structure can be seen. A museum has been erected on the site to
exhibit the material found during the excavation and to portray life in
the Tiguex province. The Coronado State Monument and Museum commemorates
the meeting, more than four hundred years ago, of the elements
that influenced the culture of New Mexico&mdash;the Indian and the <i>conquistadore</i>.</p>
<p>A curator-custodian is on duty at the Coronado Museum headquarters,
which is open all year.</p>
<h4>Pecos State Monument</h4>
<p>Off U.S. Highway 84-85, three miles south of Pecos, is this State
Monument. It became a National Monument during late 1966.</p>
<p>This mission, the Church of Nuestra Senora de los Angeles de Porciuncula
at Pecos, dates from the year 1617. It is fitting that this mission,
which was one of the first two, with Jemez, established by the Franciscans
in New Mexico, should bear the name &ldquo;Our Lady of the Angels of Porciuncula,&rdquo;
for with his own hands, St. Francis, founder of the Order, rebuilt
the decaying chapel of Our Lady of Angels at Assisi, which he called
his Porciuncula or &ldquo;Little Inheritance,&rdquo; and there established the headquarters
of the Franciscan Order.</p>
<p>Pecos was well fortified because of its location on the eastern edge of
the pueblo area and its contact with the Plains Indians. It resisted the raids
for many years, but when a smallpox epidemic in 1838 reduced the population
to seventeen survivors, they moved to Jemez Pueblo, abandoning
Pecos.</p>
<p>A part of the massive adobe walls of the ruined mission has been
excavated and repaired, as have some of the rubble masonry walls.</p>
<h4>Jemez State Monument</h4>
<p>This Monument is at Jemez Springs, sixty miles north of Albuquerque
on State Highway 4.</p>
<p>One of the finest early mission churches was established at Giusewa
Pueblo. <i>Giusewa</i> means &ldquo;place of the boiling waters&rdquo; in the language of
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
the Jemez Indians, and refers to the famous Jemez Hot Springs nearby.
The mission, with Pecos, was one of the two earliest in New Mexico. These
were founded one hundred and fifty-two years before the first California
missions.</p>
<p>The original settlement of the Giusewa Pueblo goes back hundreds
of years before Columbus&rsquo; discovery of America, as does the settlement
of the other pueblos, Quarai, Abo, and Pecos.</p>
<p>Guisewa Pueblo became extinct during the last quarter of the seventeenth
century, a result of the consolidation of several pueblos of the
Jemez province into fewer and larger towns. Only one town, the present
Jemez Pueblo, survives from that time. Excavation and repairs have been
made in the ruins of both the pueblo and the mission church.</p>
<h4>La Mesilla State Monument</h4>
<p>This colorful State Monument consists of the plaza in the village of
Mesilla, near Las Cruces, and the buildings nearby. The Monument preserves
an aspect of the Mexican Colonial culture and architecture which
flourished here in the early nineteenth century. The Gadsden Purchase
of 1853 was celebrated in the Mesilla Plaza and the famous desperado,
Billy the Kid, once stood trial here for his life. During the Civil War,
Mesilla was briefly the Confederate capitol of the Territory of Arizona.</p>
<h4>Lincoln State Monument</h4>
<p>Located in Lincoln, on U.S. Highway 380, and known as the Old
Lincoln County Courthouse, the first floor of this Monument was the
mercantile store of L. G. Murphy &amp; Co. in the 1870&rsquo;s, during the Lincoln
County War. The second floor was purchased in 1870 by the county
for a court house.</p>
<p>It was from this building that Billy the Kid made his daring escape
on April 28, 1881, after killing his two guards. A caretaker and a museum
attendant are on duty at all times. Mementos of the infamous Lincoln
County cattle war are featured.</p>
<h4>Fort Selden State Monument</h4>
<p>The crumbling adobe walls of Fort Selden lie about seventeen miles north
of Las Cruces just west of Interstate Highway 25. The history of this fort,
given in the article on <i>Frontier Forts</i>, was highlighted by the brief stay
of General Douglas MacArthur, who spent some of his childhood within
the fort&rsquo;s walls and played in the adjoining green valley of the Rio Grande.</p>
<h3 id="c12">NEW MEXICO STATE PARKS</h3>
<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">The Editors</span></p>
<p>New Mexico is blessed with a wealth of natural resources and perhaps
most important is the abundance of sites with outstanding scenic and recreational
facilities. The contrasts apparent in the mosaic of New Mexico
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
are also seen in the pattern of its state parks. They range from desert
regions with sparse and exotic flora and fauna to the high mountain canyons
choked with Douglas fir and aspen where even in the summer evenings
one huddles close to the fire for warmth. And the mosaic shifts from
waterless areas amid geologic wonders to wide expanses of open water well
stocked with trout. The parks are administered by the New Mexico State
Park and Recreation Commission. Wherever possible, areas have been set
aside for the permanent enjoyment of the people of New Mexico and
their visitors.</p>
<h4>Bottomless Lakes State Park</h4>
<p>Bottomless Lakes State Park, established in 1936, was one of the first
of the New Mexico state parks. It is surprising to find this treasure of
great natural beauty in an area so dominated by aridity. There are six
small lakes in the park, of which Lea Lake is the largest with about 15
acres of surface area. The water of the lakes is crystal clear and varies in
depth from 45 feet in the shallow lakes to about 100 feet in the deeper
ones. They were created as &ldquo;sink holes&rdquo; when water dissolved large areas
of underground gypsum, resulting in cave-ins. The lakes now offer extensive
recreational facilities for the people of New Mexico and for tourists
passing through or visiting the area. Camping, swimming, and boating
are available. Pecos &ldquo;diamonds,&rdquo; small quartz crystals, can be found in the
neighboring hills.</p>
<h4>Conchas Lake State Park</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig48">

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Sketch of Bottomless Lake</span></p>
</div>
<p>Conchas Lake is one of the largest sustained bodies of water in New
Mexico. Conchas Dam, which holds the water of the Canadian River,
forms the lake. The main dam is 235 feet above the roadway and is 1250
feet in length. At capacity it holds 600,000 acre-feet of water. The reservoir
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
serves many purposes: flood control, local irrigation, camping and boating
facilities, and fishing and water skiing.</p>
<p>The Canadian River has its origin on Raton Mesa and flows southward
to Conchas Dam, then turns abruptly eastward. On its way across the
High Plains, it cuts into some of the oldest rocks that can be seen on the
western edge of the plains, the Dockum Group of Late Triassic age. The
best place to view the earth-building processes of this region is where
State Highway 120 crosses the gorge of the Canadian River between
Wagon Mound and Roy.</p>
<h4>Hyde Memorial State Park</h4>
<p>Here, at an elevation of 9000 feet, among tall pines and aspens is one
of the most scenic of all New Mexico&rsquo;s parks. High in the Sangre de
Cristo Mountains, eight miles northeast of Santa Fe, the park offers an
excellent example of the scenic beauty in New Mexico rarely seen by
most travelers passing through the state. Easily accessible from Santa Fe,
Hyde Park gives a few moments, or a few days, respite in the cool refreshment
of a mountain forest. Excellent picnic and camping facilities are
available. For those who want to penetrate the mountain vastness even
farther, there are a number of well-marked trails for hiking.</p>
<h4>Navajo Lake State Park</h4>
<p>Navajo Dam on the San Juan River lies twenty-five miles east of Aztec
at an elevation of 6200 feet in a region of spectacular scenic beauty. Camping,
picnicking, boating, fishing, and water skiing facilities are available,
and a lodge is under construction. This is expected to be one of the most
important sports and recreational centers in northwest New Mexico in
coming years.</p>
<h4>Pancho Villa State Park</h4>
<p>Named for the famous Mexican bandit and revolutionary leader, the
park is located near Columbus, New Mexico, site of Villa&rsquo;s most infamous
raid. In the dead of the night on March 10, 1916, Villa and his men entered
the town of Columbus and did their bloody work. When they left, seventeen
local people were dead, including eight soldiers and nine civilians.
The Mexican force suffered heavy casualties, perhaps as many as 125
killed. The town of Columbus was badly damaged and has only recently
begun to recover from the blow. The expedition of General Pershing,
then on duty along the Mexican border, was organized to hunt down Villa
and his men. Pershing and a United States military unit spent three
months inside Mexico, only to return to the United States empty-handed.
The park commemorates one of the most interesting and tragic episodes in
New Mexico history. Within the park, one can see excellent examples of
Sonoran desert flora. Picnic facilities and camping sites are available.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h4>El Vado Lake State Park</h4>
<p>El Vado Dam is a part of the complex Rio Grande Conservancy District
flood and irrigation project. It holds the water of the Chama River,
which flows west, south, and then east into the Rio Grande. The country
surrounding El Vado Lake is beautiful and contains some of the finest trout
fishing streams in the state. At the lake itself there are camping facilities,
including trailer spaces (no hookups for water or electricity). The lake is
at an elevation of 7000 feet and is one of the important flood-control
bodies of water in New Mexico.</p>
<h4>Bluewater State Park</h4>
<p>Bluewater Lake, at an elevation of 7460 feet, is a spot of spectacular
beauty. Adjacent is a 160-acre wooded park. The area offers boating, fishing,
and swimming. The lake was formed by impounding the waters from
the Zuni Mountains&rsquo; watershed, and it fills three great depressions in high
tablelands. The dam, built across two lofty natural walls of solid rock,
the San Andres Limestone, holds a lake a mile wide and seven and a half
miles long. Bluewater Lake State Park was the first of New Mexico&rsquo;s
parks, so designated in 1929.</p>
<h4>Storrie Lake State Park</h4>
<p>Storrie Lake State Park surrounds a small lake north of Las Vegas,
New Mexico. It lies on the west edge of the High Plains and is an excellent
recreation area. The lake is at an elevation of 6400 feet and has a
limited number of picnic and camping facilities. It is stocked with rainbow
and brown trout and crappies.</p>
<h4>City of Rocks State Park</h4>
<p>This is one of the most unusual of the state parks, and one of the
finest for picnicking and for camping. Located in the unusual rock formation
known as the Sugarlump Welded Rhyolite Tuff northwest of Deming,
it is a source of wonder to all visitors. Suddenly, in a seemingly flat,
desert plain, one comes upon these grotesque outcrops. In the coolness of
the shade of these ancient rocks one can survey vistas under an azure sky
that are almost breathless. This is the desert Southwest at its very best;
not the harsh, unfriendly desert of movies and fiction, but a lovely spot
in which to enjoy to the fullest the wonders of nature.</p>
<h4>Kit Carson Memorial Park</h4>
<p>This 20-acre plot of grass, flower beds, trees, and picnic tables lies on
the northeast edge of Taos and contains the graves of Kit Carson and
Padre Jos&eacute; Martinez. Not far away is the Kit Carson House, a group of
adobe buildings surrounding a patio, that was Carson&rsquo;s headquarters, office,
and home from 1858 to 1866. This Indian fighter, trapper, hunter, and
trader is most famous for defeating the Navajos in Canyon de Chelly and
marching 7000 of these Indians across New Mexico to a reservation at
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
Bosque Redondo near Fort Sumner. However, during his eight years as
Indian agent, Carson worked continuously for the welfare of his charges.</p>
<h4>Oasis State Park</h4>
<p>One of the state&rsquo;s newest parks, Oasis is seven miles northeast of Portales
along State Highway 467. This shady place of cottonwood trees amid
sand dunes has long been a favorite picnic spot. The sand dunes form an
irregular ridge separating Portales Valley to the south from Blackwater
Draw to the north. In Blackwater Draw have been found bones of ancient
animals and the weapons used by early man some 12,000 years ago. Portales
Valley is the sand-filled remnant of the early Pleistocene Brazos
River Valley that once drained eastward into Texas. About 800,000 years
ago, the Pecos River to the west &ldquo;captured&rdquo; the headwaters of this former
Brazos River and left the Portales Valley high and dry.</p>
<h4>Valley of Fires State Park</h4>
<p>This park, about five miles west of Carrizozo on U.S. Highway 380,
features picnic tables amid the Carrizozo lava flow, or malpais, one of the
youngest in the United States. The lava flowed out of Little Black Peak
about 1000 years ago in a series of individual &ldquo;rivers&rdquo; of hot black basalt.
The composite flow is 44 miles long, 0.5 to 6 miles wide, and is made up
of about 1 cubic mile of basalt; it moved southward down the lowest part
of the northern Tularosa Basin.</p>
<p>Climb around on the lava and note the ropy nature of the surface
(<i>pahoehoe</i> of the Hawaiians), the many frozen gas bubbles in the rocks
(vesicles), the squeeze-ups where once-liquid lava protrudes through cracks
in the hardened crust, the pressure ridges where the hardened crust arched
and broke, and collapsed lava tunnels where the outer lava froze and the
molten interior ran out, leaving an open tube or cave.</p>
<h4>Ute Lake State Park</h4>
<p>Ute Dam, two miles southwest of Logan, provides a 4200-acre reservoir
along the Canadian River and Ute Creek stocked with rainbow trout, bass,
crappie, and catfish. Camping, picnicking, and boating facilities are available
along the valley walls, which are cut in the brown Santa Rosa Sandstone
and overlying maroon to green Chinle shales.</p>
<h4>Santa Fe River State Park</h4>
<p>Bordering the Santa Fe River in downtown Santa Fe, this city park
merges with the State Capitol grounds. It provides picnic tables and
benches in the shade of tall trees amid the picturesque ancient city.</p>
<h4>Elephant Butte Lake State Park</h4>
<p>The giant Elephant Butte Reservoir, impounded behind the dam five
miles east of Truth or Consequences, provides year-around fishing, boating,
water skiing, and camping. Built in brown to gray Cretaceous sandstone
and shale, the dam is overlooked by the brownish-black volcanic neck that
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
is Elephant Butte. Eastern shores are carved from the purplish and maroon
McRae layers. This is the main storage reservoir for the water that irrigates
the lush Rio Grande Valley to the south near Las Cruces and El Paso.</p>
<h4>Caballo Lake State Park</h4>
<p>Caballo Reservoir, downstream from Elephant Butte, offers excellent
facilities for water sports, its bass and crappie fishing being notable. The
State Park is fourteen miles south of Truth or Consequences and six
miles north of the dam. The spectacular rugged front of the Caballo
Mountains looms to the east, with sharp canyons and ribbed cliffs along
the valley walls cut in the tan layers of the Santa Fe Formation.</p>
<h4>Rio Grande Gorge State Park</h4>
<p>From Velarde (twelve miles north of Espanola) for seventy miles northward
to the Colorado state line, the Rio Grande Gorge is carved 500 to 800
feet into black basalt flows and tan Santa Fe Formation layers. Fishing is
exciting in the fast waters, although the northern part of the gorge is
difficult to reach. Foot and horseback trails lead to the bottom at the mouth
of Red River west of Questa where picnic units have been built.</p>
<h4>Alamogordo Lake State Park</h4>
<p>The dam of Alamogordo Reservoir blocks the Pecos River and Alamogordo
Creek northwest of Fort Sumner. Picnic, camp, and water sports
facilities lie along U.S. Highway 84 about sixteen miles northwest of
Fort Sumner. Juniper trees dot the low valley walls where the maroon to
green shale and sandstone of the Chinle Formation crop out.</p>
<h4>Rock Hound State Park</h4>
<p>Lying on the west flank of the Little Florida Mountains, Rock Hound
State Park, twelve miles southeast of Deming, offers camping and picnicking
facilities and many varieties of agate in the volcanic rocks. A few miles
to the south tower cliffs of the Florida Mountains, a landmark of southwestern
New Mexico and also happy hunting grounds for rock hounds.</p>
<h4>Clayton Lake State Park</h4>
<p>Serving the northeast corner of New Mexico, Clayton Lake State Park
lies twelve miles north of Clayton on State Highway 370, impounded by a
dam across Cieneguilla Creek. The stream bed cuts brown Dakota Sandstone,
and rolling grassy hills to the south overlie weathered basalt flows.</p>
<h4>Morphy Lake State Park</h4>
<p>Morphy Lake, backed up from a dam across Rito Morphy, lies three
miles west of Ledoux in southwestern Mora County and thirty-one miles
north of Las Vegas off State Highway 94. The 15-acre lake provides fine
trout fishing and picnicking amid stately ponderosa pines, with the canyon
walls formed by tier upon tier of Pennsylvanian limestones.</p>

<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">Fred A. Thompson</span><a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Water in the great Southwest, of which the State of New Mexico is a
part, has made for a colorful and historical background. Water, perhaps
more than anything else, has molded the lives of all inhabitants of the
area from the pueblo and lodge of the early Indian to the civilization we
know today. The fish and wildlife resources as related to water have played
an important part in everyday living and economy.</p>
<p>From data gathered by archeologists there are indications that the early
Indian used fish as part of his diet. Fish bones are found in excavated
ruins, and fish pictures are occasionally found as petroglyphs and on
pottery (<a href="#fig49">fig. 1</a>). Although the use of fish was limited, it was widespread
throughout the Southwest, not being confined to one Indian tribe or
nation.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig49">
<img src="images/p38.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="528" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 1. <span class="sc">Bowl depicting fish, found in ruins of Mimbres Indians</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>The use of fish by the white settler was likewise restricted, but it increased
as time progressed and knowledge and equipment improved. There
is only limited reference to fish for either food or sport fishing until after
the middle of the nineteenth century. Early explorers made records of fish
in various waters of New Mexico and in most instances described the new
species.</p>
<p>Originally, the waters of the desert also could be described as fish
deserts. Only three recognized kinds of food fish, as we know them today,
inhabited the waters of this region. The trout was limited to the cutthroat
species or subspecies. These were found as one subspecies in the
Rio Grande drainage and the other subspecies in the Arkansas River
drainage. The latter is reduced in numbers but a few remnants remain in
the headwaters. The former is being artificially propagated and is being
maintained successfully. The trout found in the Gila River drainage,
originally thought to be a cutthroat, then a rainbow, has been recently
described as a separate species. These trout, like the Arkansas River fish,
remain as remnants in the headwaters. For the most part, the native trout
have had a difficult time surviving in recent years because of the change
in water and land use; the habitat has become exceedingly restricted.</p>
<p>Channel catfish were originally found in the Rio Grande drainage
and continue to maintain themselves satisfactorily. Water and land manipulation,
however, present a serious threat, even to this hardy fish.</p>
<p>There are records that the gulf eel once came up the Rio Grande during
part of its life cycle. This fish of the ocean has long since disappeared&mdash;the
fate of many migrating fish when confronted with man-made obstructions
in the watercourses.</p>
<p>Waterfowl were in great abundance once, in both the upper Rio
Grande and the Pecos River drainages. These birds utilized the vast marsh
areas of the valleys during spring and fall migrations. It is presumed that
there was very little nesting of waterfowl in the early years.</p>
<p>The mammals that live in or near the water, principally fur bearers,
were in abundance as long as water habitat was abundant and prior to
unrestricted trapping. With the exception of the beaver (since restocked
and protected), many of the fur bearers once numerous are now extremely
limited in numbers or approaching extinction. There is only an occasional
sighting of the otter which was once relatively plentiful.</p>
<p>Habitat for the various water mammals, birds, and fish is found in the
drainage systems. The major system is the Rio Grande that flows through
the center of the state; the Pecos River is its tributary. In this system are
six of the seven life zones and conditions of habitat suitable to almost
any form of water-dwelling life.</p>
<p>There is a noticeable habitat change due to several causes, such as
ranching, irrigation, urban development, and a general minor change in
climatic conditions. Many variations are in direct relation, such as improper
grazing, unscreened irrigation diversions, dams, and sewage disposal,
to mention a few. There is an indication of a long-term warming
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
of the general Southwest, and though this change is fractional, it does
have a basic effect on habitat.</p>
<p>The effect of habitat change can be noted in the life of the cutthroat
trout. Early records reveal that this trout, liking cool clear water, was once
caught in the Rio Grande in the lower part of the box canyon north of
Pe&ntilde;ablanca. It was also caught near the town of Pecos. The fish can no
longer survive in the changed water conditions and is found now only in
the headwaters. Even the catfish has difficulty surviving in some sections
of the rivers for lack of water. In the lower Pecos, the catfish finds difficulty
in reproducing because of the high salt content of the river water.</p>
<p>As has already been noted, the fish that are recognized as game fish
today were in short supply a hundred years ago. It was not until the railroads
entered New Mexico that fish were imported to supplement the
native supply. In an unpublished report by the author, it was pointed out
that almost every kind of fish propagated in the United States has been
imported and stocked in waters of New Mexico. Of these, some have
survived beyond expectations and others have disappeared entirely.</p>
<p>When the railroads entered New Mexico, there were already requests
for fish in the hands of the United States Fish Commission. Fish were
delivered in especially designed fish-distribution cars and the consignee
met the cars at designated rail sidings. From the distribution cars, the
fish were further transported by wagons in water containers of various
descriptions, usually wooden barrels or watertight wooden boxes, to streams
or lakes as assigned. Because of the mode of travel at the time, the quantities
of fish so stocked were limited, but they did provide seed stock from
which their population could grow. Fish were packed on back and on
horses into relatively inaccessible areas. The procedures and techniques of
fish transportation have evolved to the present highly specialized equipment
and methods of operation.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the quantities of fish imported and planted
increased in relation to the improved transportation. The early records
indicate the numbers in the hundreds and in just a few locations; later
plantings increased both in numbers stocked and in waters stocked. The
first fish imported to supplement the native fish was the German carp. In
fact, this was the only fish imported for eight consecutive years, 1883-1890.
These early plantings were followed by catfish, German brown trout, brook
trout, yellow perch, largemouth black bass, crappie, rock bass, tench,
rainbow trout, strawberry bass, black spotted trout, bream, smallmouth
bass, salmon, white bass, and walleyed pike.</p>
<p>All the fish imported are classed as game fish except carp and tench
(the latter did not survive). The various species met their habitat requirements,
and although there were no survivals in some locations, they did
acclimate in others and have developed into a substantial fishery. Some
species are predominant while others, like the rock bass, are remnant and
taken only occasionally. The fish most sought now and predominant in
the fishery are rainbow (<a href="#fig50">fig. 2</a>) and brown trout, catfish, largemouth bass,
crappie, and walleyed pike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>

<img src="images/p39.jpg" alt="" width="689" height="801" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 2. <span class="sc">Joy of the fisherman, rainbow trout</span></p>
</div>
<p>Management of the fishery has progressed with technical development.
When fish were planted in early years, very little thought was
given about the habitat except that it was water. There was little known
of the requirements of fish. As a result, fish were placed in waters only to
perish. To maintain a fish population now, all techniques available are employed
and fish are stocked where water and species are compatible.</p>
<p>Water in the desert is always at a premium for the inhabitants. The
early Indian cultures used water for irrigation, and there are still vestiges
of canals used by Indians to convey water to their crops. The use of water
by the Indians then had little or no effect on fish life, but as irrigation
development increased, a new habitat was formed. The once free-flowing
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
rivers became dry in places, and new waters were developed in the drainage
ditches in the Rio Grande Valley. The competition for water is very
keen and fish and wildlife uses come after domestic, commercial, and irrigation
purposes.</p>
<p>The water requirements are so great, in fact, that it has been necessary
to control water and its use by laws. The law of 1876 provided that water
could not be refused a traveler. Community ditch commissioners were
established by law in 1895. The basic laws governing water rights were
established in 1907. These laws have been amended or added to as
conditions dictate. Conservancy districts were recognized by law in 1927,
and underground waters came under law in 1931. The Interstate Stream
Commission was created in 1935. At present, New Mexico water laws are
considered some of the best in the nation; however, it has been only recently
that water for fish and wildlife has been recognized as one of the
beneficial uses.</p>
<p>Converse to the use of water to the detriment of fish and wildlife,
there are several areas in which water has been developed and impounded
to the benefit of the fishery. Although some impoundments were single-purpose
developments, they supply habitat in conservation pools or during
years of abundant water supply.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig51">
<img src="images/p39a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="543" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 3. <span class="sc">Find the elephant!&mdash;at Elephant Butte reservoir</span></p>
</div>
<p>Waters impounded by man but used as a fishery are Elephant Butte
Reservoir (<a href="#fig51">fig. 3</a>), 40,096 surface acres when full. It contains largemouth
black bass, crappie, walleyed pike, catfish, and sunfish. This lake has not
been full for many years; but like Alamogordo Reservoir (4650 surface
acres), Caballo Reservoir (11,532 surface acres), McMillan Reservoir
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
(2500 surface acres), Conchas Reservoir (16,640 surface acres), and Avalon
Reservoir (950 surface acres), it has produced excellent fishing. These
are large irrigation lakes and are all stocked generally with the same species
of fish.</p>
<p>The lakes built for irrigation but utilized for trout are usually much
smaller. The principal ones are Navajo Reservoir (15,600 surface acres)
and El Vado (3500 surface acres). There are also Miami Lake (190 surface
acres) and several others of small size.</p>
<p>In addition, several small lakes have been built or acquired for the
primary purpose of providing fishing. A few of these are Hopewell Lake
(14 surface acres), Lake Roberts (73 surface acres), and Charette Lakes
(400 surface acres). There are many more varying in size. The smaller
lakes are primarily for trout fishing, but a few in the southern part of
the state do have species usually found in warmer waters.</p>
<p>In the process of reservoir construction, waterfowl habitat and resting
areas are created. These new lakes, however, are a poor substitute for the
natural marshes and potholes originally frequented by ducks and geese.
Water mammals, likewise, find the artificial impoundments undesirable
in comparison, and the increased water has added very little to this
resource.</p>
<p>Every water development has with it the appeal of recreation other
than fishing. Now a lake must have such facilities as picnic and camping
areas, launching ramps, good accessibility, boat rentals, and a concessionaire.
There is no single-purpose reservoir in respect to recreation.</p>
<p>Finally, it is concluded that the old adage, &ldquo;fishing ain&rsquo;t what it used to
be,&rdquo; should no longer be true for New Mexico. The fishing water has been
added to greatly and the fish are managed better. The only problem is
one of increased human population. Where there was one fisherman fifty
years ago, there are a thousand now.</p>
<p>Truly, the water of the desert is used to the limit.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">The Indians of New Mexico</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">Paige W. Christiansen</span></p>
<p>People entering New Mexico today find Indian cultures and Indian
villages with traditions and ways of life that have changed little in many
centuries. In this respect, man in the twentieth century shares an experience
in common with Coronado, O&ntilde;ate, and all the other <i>conquistadores</i>
who visited New Mexico so many generations ago. They, too, found the
ancient Indian cultures strangely magnetic and exciting. If we could
but remove the asphalt highways, the billboards, the telephone poles, and
fences that seem always to surround us, the Indian villages in many parts
of the state would look very much as they looked to the early Spanish explorers
who were the first Europeans to see them. To meet the Indians of
New Mexico and to visit their homes, if possible, is one of the greatest experiences
available to residents and visitors alike. Although words are inadequate
to give the true flavor and excitement of the Indian and his way
of life, they are all we have to introduce the various people who make up
the Indian population of New Mexico.</p>
<p>There are two main groups that should be known. First, the Pueblo
Indians, those who developed sedentary village life and who are the
descendants of the first Americans in New Mexico. Second, the &ldquo;newcomers&rdquo;
to the state, those who, for some reason or other, moved into the
state to replace earlier cultures. Let us, then, visit some of these people&rsquo;s
homes.</p>
<h4>Acoma Pueblo</h4>
<p>Acoma Indian Pueblo, the Sky City, is famous in both history and
legend. Built on the top of a lofty, almost inaccessible, redrock mesa some
357 feet high, it is one of the most picturesque of all New Mexico Indian
pueblos. No other pueblo gives one such a clear sense of living in ancestral
times. The movements of the people up and down the steep trails,
the untiring vistas, and the ancient homesites are reminiscent of the life
and times of the cliff dwellers. Here the archeologists can search out the
secrets of ancient life by direct observation. Here, too, is brought forth in
the fullness of its bloom an Indian culture of outstanding achievement.</p>
<p>The Indians of Acoma participated in the great Pueblo Revolt of
1680. They killed their priest, Fray Lucas Maldonado, in the first frenzy
of the rebellion. Because of their isolation and the inaccessibility of the
village, they were spared the vengeance of the Spaniards under de Vargas
during the reconquest in 1692. There was an attempt by the Spanish in
1696 to take Acoma, but they succeeded only in destroying the crops
and in capturing five Acoma warriors. The Indians held out until July 6,
1699, when they submitted to the Spanish governor of New Mexico, Governor
Cubero. Thereafter, Acoma became an integral part of the mission
complex established in New Mexico by the Spanish.</p>

<p>Acoma is noted for its excellent pottery. The ware is fashioned from
clay of fine quality, is very well fired, and is carefully decorated in typical
Acoma designs. Here is an excellent example of Indian artistic ability.
Some weaving, such as belts and headbands, is engaged in and a few
baskets are produced, but Acoma is most famous for its pottery.</p>
<p>One of the landmarks at Acoma is the great church which brave Fray
Juan Ramirez toiled to create in the early seventeenth century. Surely there
are few memorials of the Spanish epoch in the Southwest that present
such a picture of dauntless faith in spiritual ideals as does this fortress
church silhouetted high against the sky above the bare-rock mesa. It measures
150 feet in length and has walls that are 60 feet high and 10 feet
thick. Timbers 40 feet long and 14 inches through support the roof and
make a handsome ceiling. There are, of course, no seats and little decoration.
And what a location for so magnificent a spiritual center it is! From
there one may lift his eyes in rapt admiration of the splendid panorama
of the great plain and the encircling mountains, and thereby appreciate
more fully the work of the Deity.</p>
<p>The Acoma are agriculturists, cultivating their lands by irrigation;
they raise corn, wheat, melons, squashes, and hay. Now, however, most
of the people of Acoma do not live on their mesa which protected them
for so many centuries. The dangers of attack are no longer present, and
the farmers find it more advantageous to live closer to their irrigated plots.
The result is that the people of Acoma are now scattered throughout
several villages. Their great culture, their traditions, their fierce pride,
and their deep reverence for their spectacular history is visible in their
faces and manners. Acoma, the Sky City, remains the eternal city of
New Mexico.</p>
<h4>Cochiti Pueblo</h4>
<p>The Indians of Cochiti Pueblo claim the famed cave dwellings and
ruins of the Rito de Frijoles (Bandelier National Monument) as their
ancestral home. Failure of timber and water resources plus the constant
attack of the various Apache Indian tribes over several centuries caused
the residents of the Rito de Frijoles to seek a better home. This probably
occurred about 1200 <span class="small">A.D.</span> In 1598, when Juan de O&ntilde;ate, colonizer of New
Mexico, arrived, the Indians of Cochiti were living in their present village.
For a short time following the reconquest of New Mexico by de Vargas
after the Pueblo Revolt, the people of Cochiti lived in Ca&ntilde;ada de Cochiti,
which was in a better position for defense against Spanish reconquest. In
1694, de Vargas took the canyon village by storm, burned it, and forced
the people to return to the older village of Cochiti where they remain
to this day.</p>
<p>The population of the village is slightly more than 300, and there has
been little growth in the past thirty years. Like the other New Mexico
pueblos, the main occupation is agriculture. Their ancient traditions are
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
well preserved, among them the well-known Rain Dance held during
the annual festival of San Buenaventura in July.</p>
<p>Located at the pueblo is the ancient and beautiful Spanish mission,
San Buenaventura de Cochiti, built in the early seventeenth century. To
step into this church is to return to the Spanish days of yore. There are
no seats, women kneel on one side, the men on the other, and the services
are a mixture of old world orthodoxy and new world Indian traditions.
Cochiti represents one of the finest examples of modern Pueblo Indian life.</p>
<h4>Isleta Pueblo</h4>
<p>Isleta Pueblo is the southernmost of the pueblos lying along the green
and lush Rio Grande Valley today. It stands on the same site it occupied
when Coronado came in 1540 and was a stopping place for every Spanish
explorer and traveler who passed through New Mexico. It did not take
part in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, but rather joined the Spanish in the
retreat to El Paso del Norte (modern Juarez, Mexico). There they founded
a new village just to the south of modern El Paso which they called
Isleta del Sur. The main village of Isleta, in New Mexico, remained
deserted until 1709 when it was re-established by Fray Juan de la Pe&ntilde;a.</p>
<p>Two different missions were built at Isleta Pueblo. The first, San
Antonio de Isleta, was constructed about 1629. The church was burned
in 1680, and in 1681 was being used as a sheep corral. Between 1680 and
the completion of the reconquest, it was completely destroyed. The second
mission, still remaining at Isleta, called San Agustin de Isleta, was built
in 1709 on the old site.</p>
<p>Agriculture is the primary pursuit of the Indians of Isleta, although
they do considerable stock grazing. The population of Isleta is nearly
2000 persons. The annual fiesta takes place in late August.</p>
<h4>Jemez Pueblo</h4>
<p>The Jemez Indians were first seen by Europeans in 1541 when they
were visited by Captain Francisco de Barrio-Nuevo, of Coronado&rsquo;s expedition.
He counted seven villages, naming them Aguas Calientes because
of the many hot springs in the canyon of the Jemez River. The ancient
pueblos are now all in ruins, with one preserved as the Jemez State
Monument. The present pueblo, built on the mesa where the Jemez
River leaves the mountains, was constructed after the Pueblo Revolt. The
Jemez people fled their older villages during the reconquest and for a
time lived with the Navajo, whom they disliked but preferred to the
Spanish.</p>
<p>There have been four notable missions among the Jemez Indians.
The first, San Diego de Jemez Mission, was built in the early seventeenth
century. It was one of the most successful of the New Mexico
missions; reportedly, more than 6000 converts were made among the
Jemez Indians before 1622. Because of the constant attacks of the Navajo,
the traditional enemies of the Jemez people, the ancient pueblos gradually
declined and were finally completely abandoned after Jemez participation
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
in the Pueblo Revolt. The ruins of this church, now the Jemez State
Monument, are among the most picturesque in all New Mexico. Its walls
are three feet thick and were put together with intricate care. In its time,
it must have been a beautiful building.</p>
<p>The second, San Juan de Los Jemez Mission, was built in 1617 at a
village located near the junction of the Guadalupe and Jemez rivers, six
miles north of the present pueblo. The ruins are faint but still visible.
The mission was abandoned in 1680.</p>
<p>The third mission had a very brief history. It was called San Jose de los
Jemez Mission and was located near San Juan de Los Jemez, of which it
was a <i>visita</i>. Like San Juan, San Jose was abandoned in 1680.</p>
<p>The present mission was founded early in the eighteenth century and
is one of the interesting things to visit at Jemez Pueblo. This old church
is the center of the annual festival held at Jemez on November 12.</p>
<p>Jemez is noted for its splendid presentation of the Buffalo Dance in
the winter and for its Corn Dances during the November festival.</p>
<h4>Laguna Pueblo</h4>
<p>Laguna Pueblo is the youngest and second largest of the pueblos in
New Mexico. Built in 1697, shortly after the reconquest by de Vargas,
the name was derived from a large lake which existed at one time just
west of the village. In addition to the main village, a number of small
settlements have developed where the terrain is suitable for agriculture,
the main occupation of the Lagunas. The most important of these villages
are Paguate, Encinal, Paraje, Mesita, Seama, and Casa Blanca. The
Laguna Indians are of mixed origin, composed of four linguistic stocks:
Tano, Keres, Shoshone, and Zuni.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig55">
<img src="images/p42.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="487" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Rock-walled Santa Maria mission, Laguna Reservation</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Although the occupation of the pueblo was traditionally agriculture,
in recent years a moderate revolution has been visible. The people of
Laguna are in the middle of one of the richest uranium mining areas in
the world, and many of them have been employed in mining activities.
Also, the pueblo lies on the main line of the Santa Fe Railway, allowing
some employment with the railroad. Laguna Pueblo is one of the most
progressive of all the Indian groups in New Mexico. It has a population
well in excess of 3000.</p>
<p>Located at Laguna is the San Jose de Laguna mission, built in 1699.
The plaster on the building is native earth. Indian symbols are painted
on the ceiling of the chancel, and a large picture of St. Joseph done on
elk skin hangs on the reredos. The halos on the saints are triangular
rather than circular. The altar is covered with animal skins painted with
Christian symbols.</p>
<h4>Namb&eacute; Pueblo</h4>
<p>Namb&eacute; is one of the smallest of the pueblos but is located in an area
noted for its scenic beauty and climate. Its population is less than 200. It
was not always so small; during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
the population was greatly reduced by intertribal war and witchcraft
executions. The Namb&eacute; people played an active role in the pueblo rebellion
of 1680, murdering their priest and destroying their church.</p>
<p>The original church at Namb&eacute; was one of the first missions founded
after the establishment of the first European settlement of San Gabriel
at San Juan in 1598. Destroyed in 1680, it was rebuilt in 1696. In 1729,
the converts had increased to such numbers that a new church was required.
This church remained in use until 1909 when, because of carelessness
in keeping it in repair, the roof collapsed during a storm. The
annual Namb&eacute; fiesta is held in early October.</p>
<h4>Picur&iacute;s Pueblo</h4>
<p>Picur&iacute;s is seldom visited by the tourist, for it lies in the mountains
forty miles north of Santa Fe and can only be reached over a gravel road.
The people of Picur&iacute;s were among the most warlike of the normally
peaceful pueblo peoples. They participated actively in the pueblo rebellion
in 1680, killing their priest and all the Spaniards in the vicinity. They
also participated in the battle for Santa Fe which broke Spanish power
in New Mexico until 1692. After the revolt, fear of the Spanish caused
them to abandon their village until they were induced to return in 1706.
The population of Picur&iacute;s is very small, being slightly more than 100.</p>
<p>One of the few old missions left in New Mexico, the San Lorenzo de
Picur&iacute;s church shows the strange mixture of Spanish and Indian traditions.
Near the door is a human skull covered with an old cloth, but unfortunately,
its story is lost to antiquity.</p>
<p>An interesting feature at Picur&iacute;s is the unusual construction seen in
some of the buildings. Made of puddled adobe, they are the oldest still
standing of any pueblo in the Rio Grande Valley. The buildings were
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
made by pouring adobe mud into wall forms. This is the same kind of
construction that is found at Casa Grande, Arizona, one of the significant
prehistoric ruins in the United States.</p>
<h4>Pojoaque Pueblo</h4>
<p>Pojoaque, though still listed among the Indian villages of New Mexico,
is no longer populated by Indians. Two missions were established at
Pojoaque in the early Spanish days, the first shortly after 1600. This was
destroyed in the rebellion in 1680. Later, in 1706, a new church was
constructed which is still in use. The Indian population of Pojoaque was
gradually reduced until, in 1900, the few remaining families abandoned
the village. Since that time, Spanish-American families have occupied the
buildings. It is a picturesque village seldom seen, for it is hidden from the
passing tourist by a hill. Yet some of the buildings in this ancient village
date back to pre-Coronado times and are a significant part of the romance
of New Mexico.</p>
<h4>Sandia Pueblo</h4>
<p>Sandia Pueblo is a remnant of the Tiguex villages visited by Coronado
in 1540. A mission was created at Sandia shortly after the colonization
by O&ntilde;ate, and it was an important mission center until the Pueblo Revolt.
After the revolt, Sandia peoples scattered rather than again submit
to Spanish control. Many of them went to live with the Hopi and there
founded the village of Payupki on the middle mesa, the walls of which
can still be found. After 62 years, in 1742, a few families returned to the
Rio Grande Valley to found the modern pueblo. The old mission remains
visible, although reduced to a rubble of adobe. Sandia Pueblo remains
a small village, containing less than 150 people.</p>
<h4>San Felipe Pueblo</h4>
<p>San Felipe is one of the most conservative of the pueblos and has retained
much of its Indian heritage despite the impact of Spanish and
American influences. It has a close affinity with its neighbors, particularly
Santo Domingo only five miles distant. San Felipe was a well-established
village when the Spanish first arrived. Its people joined in heartily when
the pueblo uprising began in 1680 but abandoned their village during a
Spanish counteroffensive in 1681 (which failed). When reconquest was
completed in 1692, the people returned to their village. Thereafter, they
remained friendly to the Spanish and suffered many attacks from the
Navajo, who hated them for this loyalty.</p>
<p>One of the finest remaining structures showing early Franciscan
mission architecture can be seen at the San Felipe church. The present
church is not the original mission, for three different churches were located
at San Felipe over the centuries. The first was built in 1605 and
destroyed during the Pueblo Revolt. The second was built in a new
part of the village in 1694, but shortly after 1700, the village was
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
moved and a new church constructed. The latter church is the one
now in use at San Felipe. On May 1, the nearly 1000 people of the
pueblo celebrate their annual fiesta.</p>
<h4>San Ildefonso Pueblo</h4>
<p>San Ildefonso has gained fame throughout the world because of the
excellence of its pottery. The high quality and general acceptance of this
commodity has made the village prosperous. It boasts some of the most
famous Indian artists and artisans in the United States, among them Julian
and Maria Martinez, perhaps the best-known potters in the world.</p>
<p>San Ildefonso participated in the Pueblo Revolt but did not contest
the reconquest, at least not at first. In 1694, when de Vargas began
to wage war on the northern pueblos, San Ildefonso did take part.
The people fortified themselves on Black Mesa, a high, steep mesa of
volcanic origin near the pueblo. There they successfully withstood
Spanish efforts to dislodge them. Notwithstanding their initial success,
they were ultimately conquered and brought into the Spanish system.
Today there are several hundred people living in the village, and they
are among the friendliest of the pueblo peoples. San Ildefonso is easily
accessible from Santa Fe.</p>
<p>The mission church dates back to the 1890&rsquo;s, although earlier churches
at the pueblo played an important role in bringing Christianity to the
Pueblo Indian world. The older churches are long since gone.</p>
<h4>San Juan Pueblo</h4>
<p>San Juan Pueblo is best noted for its close association with the first
Spanish settlement in New Mexico in 1598. O&ntilde;ate, colonizer of New Mexico,
selected a site for his first headquarters which was a part of the ancient
Pueblo of San Juan. The natives living in that part of the village willingly
gave up their homes to the Spaniards and were taken in by the remainder
of the people of San Juan. O&ntilde;ate, in appreciation for this hospitality, bestowed
upon the pueblo the name <i>San Juan de los Caballeros</i>, a name
which the pueblo is still proud to bear.</p>
<p>Yet this same friendly people also contributed Po-p&eacute;, the great leader
of the Pueblo Revolt, to the history of New Mexico. While Po-p&eacute; shared
with many other pueblo leaders a hatred of the Spanish conqueror, he
was the spiritual force and the organizer of the rebellion that broke the
control of the Spaniard for twelve years and returned New Mexico to
the Indian. This great rebellion stands as one of the significant efforts
in the history of the world of a people to cast off the bonds of foreign
control.</p>
<p>San Juan cannot claim a church dating back to the <i>conquistadores</i>, but
it does have one of the great landmark churches in the Southwest. In
1890, the chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes was dedicated at San Juan. It
was constructed of red volcanic rock found west of the Rio Grande. This
beautiful structure is an architectural jewel set in desert surroundings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The nearly 700 people of San Juan welcome visitors to their homes;
their undecorated burnished black pottery is particularly distinctive and
popular. The pueblo&rsquo;s annual festival is held in June.</p>
<h4>Santa Ana Pueblo</h4>
<p>Santa Ana Pueblo lies along the banks of the Rio Jemez, which enters
the Rio Grande from the west. The pueblo was visited by O&ntilde;ate and a
mission was built there about 1600, shortly after his visit. The people of
Santa Ana joined in the Pueblo Revolt, and since there was no priest
serving their church in 1680, they joined with the Indians of Santo
Domingo and San Felipe to massacre the padres at San Felipe. In 1687,
during one of the Spanish efforts to reconquer New Mexico, Santa Ana
was destroyed and her people fled. Later, at the urging of de Vargas, the
modern pueblo was established, along with the church now standing there.
The population of Santa Ana is nearly 400. Its annual festival takes
place in August. It is often difficult to find many of the people at the
main pueblo for they spend most of the growing season at El Ranchito, to
the east in the Rio Grande Valley.</p>
<h4>Santa Clara Pueblo</h4>
<p>Santa Clara Pueblo is near the mouth of Santa Clara Creek, a year-round
stream flowing out of the Jemez Mountains into the Rio Grande.
To the west of the pueblo, on lands owned by Santa Clara, are the famous
Puye Cliff Dwellings ruins. The people of Santa Clara claim these natural
cliff homes as their ancestral dwelling places, a fact which has been substantiated
by archeologists. The Santa Clara Indians represent, then, an
important living Indian group in which one can observe institutions and
traditions that can be linked to traditions of the cultures that lived in the
caves and abandoned cities of Southwest antiquity.</p>
<p>Like most of the pueblo people, Santa Clara joined the Pueblo Revolt,
but this action did not seriously harm the pueblo. The real damage was
done to Santa Clara in the late eighteenth century when intertribal warfare
over witchcraft, plus the ravages of disease, took nearly 500 lives in
the village. The current population is about 500.</p>
<p>The church at Santa Clara is quite modern, having been constructed
in the twentieth century. The old church, built in 1760, was caught up in
the modernization craze that swept through the pueblo world in the early
1900&rsquo;s. Perhaps one of the most substantial and beautiful of all pueblo
churches, the old church collapsed during a storm in 1909 (the same
storm that destroyed the church at Namb&eacute;); it had been structurally weakened
by the removal of the roof for remodeling.</p>
<p>The village has excellent agricultural lands and supplements its income
by manufacturing an excellent and distinctive pure black pottery.
Its annual festival is in mid-August.</p>
<h4>Santo Domingo Pueblo</h4>
<p>Santo Domingo is one of the largest of the pueblos, having a population
of nearly 1500. It is also the most conservative in retention of its
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
native culture. This makes its dances and dress of particular interest to
the visitor to New Mexico. The present pueblo was established after the
reconquest in 1692. The Indians of Santo Domingo took a particularly
active part in the Pueblo Revolt, killing three padres resident at the
pueblo. When de Vargas moved to retake Santo Domingo, he found the
people had abandoned the village. They had constructed a village in the
Jemez Mountains to the west, and it was there that de Vargas defeated
them. Even then, the people of Santo Domingo did not give up the fight,
and only after a long series of defeats and serious loss of life did they surrender
and again return to the vicinity of their original village.</p>
<p>The church at Santo Domingo is not so old as many other pueblo
edifices, but its qualities remain among the most typical aspects of early
New Mexico mission architecture. In early August, during the great
annual festival, the Indians completely clean and whitewash the church.
Two large horses are painted on the front of the building by native artists.
The dances during the Santo Domingo festival are among the most colorful
and authentic in New Mexico.</p>
<h4>Taos Pueblo</h4>
<p>Taos represents the northernmost of the pueblos in New Mexico. It is
also one of the most scenic, lying at the foot of the Taos Mountains, a spur
of the mighty Sangre de Cristo range. It is a prosperous village of about
900 persons. There is no finer example of pueblo apartment architecture
in New Mexico. The main pueblo building rises five stories above the
mesa. One must be careful not to confuse the Spanish town, don Fernando
de Taos, and the old Indian farming center, Ranchos de Taos, with
the pueblo, San Geronimo de Taos. It is the latter that is Indian and is,
therefore, by far the oldest of the three.</p>
<p>The ruins of the old San Geronimo mission at Taos represent one
of the most historic and fateful in all the Southwest. It was there that
two priests were murdered in 1680 during the first days of the Pueblo
Revolt. It was there that Po-p&eacute; sowed the first seeds of that rebellion.
Again in 1696, the Taos Indians sought to free themselves from Spanish
control by killing their priests and other Spaniards in the vicinity. Again
they were subdued. In 1847, when the Americans annexed New Mexico,
the Taos Indians tried once more to gain their independence. Inflamed
by Mexican citizens who refused to accept American authority, they
attacked the Americans at Fernando de Taos, killing nine of them. Governor
Charles Bent, builder of the famous Bent&rsquo;s Fort on the Santa Fe
Trail, was among those killed. On February 3, 1847, the American army
in New Mexico laid siege to the village and the Indians fortified themselves
in the mission. It became the Alamo of the Taos people. American
artillery was brought to bear, and the walls of the ancient church were
battered down; the Indians fled, first to the village and then into the mountains,
leaving behind 150 dead and many wounded. They were finally
forced to surrender, and their leaders were hung. Those so hung remain
martyrs to this day. The ruins of the Taos mission, built three and a quarter
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
centuries ago, still can be seen. They are a stark landmark to the
stubborn independence of the people of Taos.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/p43.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="752" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="small">(<i>Forest Service, U.S.D.A.</i>)</span><br /><span class="sc">Souvenir of the American army&rsquo;s work in 1847: Taos Pueblo mission</span></p>
</div>
<p>The traditions and ceremonials of Taos are well preserved. Their arts
and crafts, however, have declined and are not of the high quality found
in some of the other pueblos. Their ceremonials are excellent and are noted
for their beauty and precision. The feast day of San Geronimo, September
30, is the most important event of the year.</p>
<h4>Tesuque Pueblo</h4>
<p>Tesuque is a small village, perhaps numbering no more than 150 persons.
Even though it has always been small, it holds a major place in the
history of New Mexico. It was at Tesuque that the first blood was shed in
the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. On August 9, Cristobal de Herrera was murdered,
and two Tesuque Indians rushed to Santa Fe to warn the Spanish
governor of the impending rebellion. The Indian leaders, now aware that
their plot was known, moved the date of the revolt from August 13 to
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
August 10. On August 10, Father Pio, in charge of the Tesuque mission,
went out from Santa Fe to say Mass and also was murdered.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig57">
<img src="images/p43a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="594" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="small">(<i>Forest Service, U.S.D.A.</i>)</span><br /><span class="sc">Most-painted church in America?... Ranchos de Taos</span></p>
</div>
<p>Although its handicrafts are of poor quality, the Tesuque Indian ceremonials
are colorful and authentic. The people have retained much of
their early culture while living in proximity to the white man (Santa Fe is
only nine miles distant). The pueblo&rsquo;s most important festival falls on
November 12.</p>
<h4>Zia Pueblo</h4>
<p>The story of Zia is one of tragedy and difficult problems of existence.
Located on a basalt flow on the north bank of the Jemez River some
fifteen miles above its junction with the Rio Grande, Zia has poor land
and a limited supply of irrigation water. Agriculture is the main economic
pursuit, but the pueblo&rsquo;s unfortunate location makes trading for part
of its food supply necessary.</p>
<p>O&ntilde;ate reported Zia to be a large pueblo. However, it suffered greatly
because of its participation in the Pueblo Revolt. Some historians estimate
that during the reconquest, nearly 600 of the people of Zia were killed
defending themselves from the Spanish. Continued wars and pestilence
reduced the pueblo to a very few families. Over the past century, the
group has again showed signs of growth and now has a population of more
than 300.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>The church at Zia dates from 1692, and thus represents one of the fine
examples of ancient Franciscan architecture in New Mexico. The annual
festival, dedicated to Nuestra Senora de la Asuncion, is celebrated with
an excellent Corn Dance on August 15.</p>
<h4>Zuni Pueblo</h4>
<p>Zuni has the distinction of being the first of the pueblos seen or visited
by Europeans. Seen from a distance by Fray Marcos de Niza in 1539,
it was reported as a rich and extensive city. Nearby were six other pueblos,
and the Spanish immediately associated the Zuni complex with an old
Spanish legend about seven golden cities, the Seven Cities of Cibola.
The expedition of Coronado was formed to explore and conquer the rich
pueblos of New Mexico. His first contact was at Zuni, then called
<i>Hawikuh</i>. It was neither golden nor rich.</p>
<p>Although Zuni was an important stopping place on the early trails to
Mexico, it managed to remain least influenced by European ideas. The
Spanish concentrated their efforts in the Rio Grande Valley and Zuni
went its own way most of the time. While there were missionary efforts
from time to time, by the nineteenth century, the stout resistance to such
activity caused it to cease. In recent years, sporadic missionary activity
has been evident, but it has not been notably successful.</p>
<p>The most famous of all New Mexico Indian ceremonial dances is held
at Zuni each year. The Shalako, which occurs in early December, is
authentic and spectacular. The dancers, carrying huge ceremonial figures
on their shoulders, must train and practice constantly during the entire
year.</p>
<p>Zuni is the largest of the pueblos in New Mexico, with a population
numbering more than 5000 persons. The main occupation is agriculture.
The Zunis supplement their income by manufacturing silver inlay
jewelry that shows great creative skill and is beautiful to behold.</p>
<h4>Other New Mexico Indians</h4>
<p>In addition to the well-known Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, there
are four other areas of Indian lands. Three of these belong to peoples of
Athapascan origin, sometimes better known as Apache Indians. By name,
they are the Jicarilla Apache, the Mescalero Apache, and Navajo. The
fourth group is the Ute Indian.</p>
<p>The Apache tribes were relative newcomers to the Southwest. Their
origin was the plains area between the northern Rocky Mountains and
Hudson Bay in Canada. About 1000 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, a part of these northern Plains
Indians began a migration that ultimately brought them to New Mexico.
Down the High Plains across the western Dakotas, western Nebraska,
Kansas, and finally to western Texas and eastern New Mexico, these
people came. At about the latitude of Albuquerque, the migration split.
Part of the group continued south, across the Staked Plains, into southeastern
New Mexico, west Texas, and northern Coahuila and Chihuahua,
Mexico. Here they divided into the Lipan, the Mescalero, and the Natage
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
Apache. Today, in south-central New Mexico are the descendants of the
Mescalero. The Mescalero Apache reservation is crossed by U.S. Highway
70, a scenic drive through pine forests. The tribe operates the Sierra
Blanca ski area, one of the southernmost ski areas in the United States.
Its annual Crown Dance and coming-of-age ceremonials are held July
1 to 4, followed by an Apache rodeo. The Lipan and the Natage have
virtually disappeared.</p>
<p>The second group of the migration discovered for the first time in their
long trek down the eastern fringes of the Rockies that the country opened
up to the west. They poured through the passes and entered the areas
traditionally controlled by pueblo farmers. Gradually, they took over these
lands for themselves, driving out the farmers. By the time the Spanish
came on the scene, most of the peaceful farmers had given way before
the onslaught of the warlike Athapascan savages. Only one group remained,
the pueblos of the central Rio Grande Valley. The migration that
moved into the desert and mountain lands divided into a number of groups
which are known by modern names: the Chiricahua, White Mountain,
Western, and Jicarilla Apache and the Navajo. The Jicarilla Apache
reside mainly in north-central New Mexico on reservation lands, and the
Navajo reservation lies partly in extreme northwestern New Mexico. Most
of the Navajo land and all the lands of the others are in Arizona.</p>
<p>The Ute Indians, driven from the plains by stronger tribes, settled
in the central Rocky Mountain area. There they raided the wealthy (at
least in their eyes) pueblos to the south. They fought sporadically against
white penetration but were finally subdued and placed on reservation
lands in the Four Corners area, part of which lies in New Mexico.</p>
<p>While the history of these peoples is fascinating and full of romance,
there is little besides scenery to be seen when visiting their reservations.
The populations are often scattered over many hundreds of square miles,
and the people have only rudimentary handicrafts. The exception is the
Navajo, and a trip to the Navajo reservation is worthwhile. These Indians
have developed techniques of weaving and silversmithing that contribute
significant art forms to Southwest handicrafts.</p>
<p class="tb">The outstanding Indian event of the year in New Mexico is the
Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonial at Gallup, held during mid-August.
Some thirty tribes from the Southwest and Midwest meet to compete
in arts, crafts, and ceremonial dancing.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">Reminders of the Past</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">Paige W. Christiansen</span></p>
<p>When driving across New Mexico or when visiting some part of the
state, one should be aware of the wealth of history that is always close
at hand. Many people, when faced with what seems like endless miles
of empty country, fail to realize that the very emptiness is one of the
charms of the state. They also do not recognize that in the vast expanses of
mountain and desert, people of the ancient past or a recent past have lived
and worked and died. Sometimes the fruits of their labor are clear and evident
and live on in cities and towns. In many instances, however, the
mountains and desert have reclaimed their own and the works of man have
succumbed. A mental picture must be cast over the landscape on which
great historical events took place but which is almost empty of signs of
man&rsquo;s efforts. If travelers are fortunate, there may still be some sign&mdash;a
ghost town, a ruined ranch, some old artifacts&mdash;to tell the story; if not,
imagination must be given rein. The search is the adventure, and to give
aid in that search, the following might suffice as a faint guiding light.</p>
<p>To simplify the descriptions of these reminders of the past, New
Mexico is divided into seven geographical regions which a traveler might
well visit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>North from Santa Fe</i>, including U.S. Highways 64, 285, and 84,
and connecting state highways.</p>
<p>2. <i>The northeast</i>, including U.S. 85 from Santa Fe to Raton, U.S. 66
east from Albuquerque to the Texas line, U.S. 56 from Springer
to the state line, and connecting state highways.</p>
<p>3. <i>The northwest</i>, including U.S. 66 west from Albuquerque to the
Arizona line, U.S. 666 north from Gallup to Colorado, and State
Highway 44 from Bernalillo to Farmington.</p>
<p>4. <i>East-central</i>, including U.S. 60 east from Bernardo, U.S. 380 east
from San Antonio, U.S. 70 from the Mescalero Indian Reservation
to the Texas line, U.S. 285 from Clines Corners to Roswell, U.S.
54 from Three Rivers to Santa Rosa, and connecting state highways.</p>
<p>5. <i>West-central</i>, including U.S. 60 west of Socorro, U.S. 180-260 and
State Highway 12 in Catron County, U.S. 85 from Los Lunas to
Elephant Butte, and connecting state highways.</p>
<p>6. <i>Southeast</i>, including U.S. 70 from Las Cruces to the Mescalero
Indian Reservation, U.S. 54 from El Paso to Three Rivers, U.S. 62
from Hobbs to the Texas line, U.S. 285 from Roswell to the Texas
line, and numerous state roads.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>7. <i>Southwest</i>, including U.S. 85 from Truth or Consequences to El
Paso, U.S. 180 north from Deming to the Catron county line, U.S.
70-80 west from Las Cruces to Arizona, and state roads.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>North From Santa Fe</h4>
<p>The country north of Santa Fe is the heart of Indian and Spanish New
Mexico. Here, if he looks beyond the narrow boundaries of the highway
right-of-way, the traveler can see Indian and Spanish villages which have
not changed significantly in two and a half centuries. Along the lush
green of the Rio Grande Valley or of its tributaries dashing out of the
Sangre de Cristo range to the east, these sleepy concentrations of people
reveal cultural and language patterns which smack of the <i>conquistadores</i> of
the sixteenth century or of the ancient cliff dwellers. It is a slow and
easy world, perhaps most representative of the &ldquo;land of ma&ntilde;ana.&rdquo; In a
region already worked for centuries for what it can produce, there is no
hurry. It will be there tomorrow and forever. The people of this region
are typically New Mexican. The hills are dotted with pi&ntilde;on and juniper
trees which give a greenish to black cast to the land. This, too, is typically
New Mexican.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>There is one short trip that would be fruitful for him who wants to
know New Mexico, to feel the romance of Spanish culture, and to seek
adventure off the beaten track. Just north of Espa&ntilde;ola, State Highway 76
strikes east from U.S. 64. Nowhere in the state can be found so much of
old world charm or spectacular scenic beauty. Heading east, the traveler
passes through Chimay&oacute;, a village famed throughout the world for its
weaving, though seldom visited, then on through Truchas and Las Trampas
to Penasco, heart of the Penitente country. The Penitentes were a
religious sect growing out of long isolation from the main threads of
Roman Catholicism. They gradually reverted to relatively primitive
Christian practices without guidance from main church centers but within
the past few years have returned to the Church. The many white crosses
that can be seen in the area attest to their former activity. From Penasco,
the traveler can return to U.S. 64 via State Highway 75.</p>
<p>The area northwest of Santa Fe, stretching some thirty or forty miles
on the southeast flanks of the Jemez Mountains, is the noted Pajarito
Plateau, the home of great numbers of Indian cultures, living and dead.
Many of the modern Indian pueblos will be found in this region. Also,
some of the most significant ancient Indian ruins are found here, such as
the Frijoles Canyon (Bandelier National Monument) and Puye Cliff
Dwellings.</p>
<p>The entire area north of Santa Fe, then, is alive with history. In every
village, in every canyon, there is something that will add to the romance
of Spanish-Indian New Mexico. In our Southwest, the heritage handed
down by these two great cultures is held dear by the people. To the
traveler will come a greater appreciation and a greater understanding of
New Mexico and the Southwest if these are but understood.</p>
<h4>Northeast New Mexico</h4>
<p>The section designated as northeast New Mexico is an area of mountains
and plains, and its historical mosaic shows elements of both: the
rugged Sandia Mountains near Albuquerque and the southernmost parts
of the extensive Sangre de Cristo range, which thrusts north from U.S.
Highway 85 far into Colorado, and part of the famed buffalo plains. The
area is drained by two main river systems; the Canadian River flows east
to join the Arkansas and the Mississippi and the Pecos River flows south
to join the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Through this vast area ran one of Americas greatest highways, the
Santa Fe Trail. Beginning in Missouri communities, the Trail hurled itself
into the intricate patterns of the Great Plains with all of their dangers&mdash;Indians,
boredom, violent storms, treacherous rivers, and prairie grass fires.
Then on into the foothills of the mighty Rocky Mountains and the steep
and backbreaking approaches to Raton Pass in New Mexico. The new
highway across this pass (U.S. 85) and the nature of our vehicles have
made this an easy passage. But the traveler should pause at some high
point, or perhaps leave the main highway for a moment, and try to imagine
crossing this rugged land in Conestoga wagons. From Raton, the Santa Fe
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
Trail continued south to Las Vegas and thence into Santa Fe via Glorieta
Pass (current route of U.S. 85). Over this trail passed the goods of the
world. In part, these were intended for the people of New Mexico, but
over other trails they also found markets in Mexico and in California.
For the curious and adventurous, sections of the Santa Fe Trail can still
be seen. Local inquiry will elicit directions to remaining parts of the wide
rutted Trail, scene of so much of the American westward movement.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig59">

<p class="pcap"><span class="small">(<i>Forest Service, U.S.D.A.</i>)</span><br /><span class="sc">How To see the Rio Grande Valley&mdash;from Sandia Crest</span></p>
</div>
<p>While passing through the mountains between Santa Fe and Las
Vegas, the traveler should be aware that a critical Civil War battle was
waged in the fastness of these passes. In 1862, Confederate forces, which
came up the Rio Grande from Texas and won a series of victories over
Union troops, met a combined force of Colorado Volunteers and New
Mexico Union troops in a decisive contest over the control of the American
Southwest. The Union troops were successful, preserving New Mexico
and the West for the Union.</p>
<p>These, then, are some of the things to look for in this region of plains
and mountains. Picture buffalo by the tens of thousands pushing up the
Canadian River, or long lines of wagons winding their way along the
Santa Fe Trail carrying goods and people into new lands, or the Blue and
the Gray locked in deadly combat far from the thunder of the main Civil
War battles. The mosaic here is sharp and vividly different.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<h4>Northwest New Mexico</h4>
<p>Northwest New Mexico is typified as ancient Indian country. While
seemingly a harsh land, it is only this to the uninitiated, to those who lock
their minds to beauties of history and lands unlike their own. The Indian
found this country good and productive. Some of the finest ruins of Indian
antiquity are in this region&mdash;Chaco Canyon and Aztec, both National
Monuments, and hundreds more that remain unnamed. The Indians of the
Four Corners area (named thus because New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, and
Arizona meet here, the only place in the United States where the lines
of four states intersect) created levels of culture unsurpassed in what is
the continental United States; only the Indians of Mexico and Peru claim
a higher culture. This is a land whose ancient people reached their great
peak at the same time as the later Romans, as Charlemagne in ancient
Frankish Europe, and as Mohammed and his successors in the Middle
East.</p>
<p>But ancient Indians hold no monopoly on this vast region. Today many
of the Indians of New Mexico still find homes here. The Navajo Reservation
lies between Gallup and the Colorado line. Part of the Ute Reservation
lies along the northern edge of New Mexico, and the Jicarilla Reservation
is in the eastern part of this region. Many of the pueblo people
are found between Albuquerque and Santa Fe. At Gallup each year, the
famed Indian Ceremonials bring together peoples from many of the tribes
in the United States.</p>
<p>This region is also renowned as an oil and natural gas producer and is
one of the booming areas in New Mexico. But this is only one aspect of
the mineral riches of the northwest; the mines near Grants, between
Albuquerque and Gallup, produce tremendous quantities of uranium ores.
The atomic energy capability of the United States begins at Grants. And
near Gallup and Fruitland are huge open-pit coal mines.</p>
<p>The northwest is drained by the San Juan River, a tributary of the
Colorado River, and is therefore a part of the Pacific watershed. The
Navajo Dam project, just east of Farmington, is a part of this drainage
pattern.</p>
<p>Thus the region is characterized by Indians old and new, ancient
things buried deep beneath the earth, and great beauty in pastel colors
and subtle contrasts&mdash;the mosaic of the land.</p>
<h4>East-Central New Mexico</h4>
<p>East-central New Mexico, like the northeast, is an area of plains and
mountains. Here the buffalo roamed, and in their place, cattle now utilize
the hardy and nutritious grasses of the High Plains. Mountains are the
Manzano, southeast of Albuquerque, and Sierra Blanca, near Carrizozo,
as well as numerous minor ranges. Also in this region is some harsh and
desolate country, seared by the southwestern sun and lacking in rainfall,
but supporting the exotic plants and wildlife typical of the Sonoran desert
regions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>While the desert regions may not be attractive to the eye, they should
be appreciated for their part in the historical mosaic. In the area east of
the Rio Grande is the northern half of the well-known White Sands
Missile Range, one of the significant test centers in the rocket and space
age. It was also in this arid region that the first atomic bomb was exploded
(southeast of Socorro).</p>
<p>The early use of this desert, however, emphasized its harshness. For
centuries, the Spanish suffered across this waterless waste on their way
from Chihuahua in Old Mexico to Santa Fe, for this was the Jornada del
Muerto, journey of death, the hardest and most dangerous part of the
trip over the Camino Real. The Camino Real was the lifeline of New
Mexico from 1598 until the Santa Fe Trail was opened in 1821, and all
visitors during that period were obliged to cross this arid section. A modern
rocket crosses in mere seconds what took the Spaniards many days.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig60">

<p class="pcap"><span class="small">(<i>Forest Service, U.S.D.A.</i>)</span><br /><span class="sc">Who says this is desert country?... Sierra Blanca from <span class="smaller">U.S.</span> 70</span></p>
</div>
<p>In the Manzano Mountains, there are numerous Indian ruins which
represent the eastern fringes of the pueblo-building Indians of New Mexico.
These ruined villages have been given the name by historians of
&ldquo;cities that died of fear,&rdquo; fear of the vicious Apache and Comanche tribes.
For centuries, these brave village people tilled their crops and lived peacefully
on the land. Then, in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries,
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
the great migrations of Plains Indians that pushed into the Southwest
gradually did their deadly work. One by one the villages succumbed,
until by 1700 few people remained, and these were ultimately killed or
driven into the sanctuary of the Rio Grande pueblos. It is awesome to stand
mid the rubble of one of those ancient cities and imagine the circumstances
of its demise.</p>
<p>In the eastern part of this section was the heart of the High Plains
cattle empires. Here is a land that once belonged to the great cattle barons,
a land of free range, the home of the cowboy. Although it is fenced today,
it is still a land of cattle and is still very close to the early days of the
cattleman.</p>
<p>Again, there is an intricate and varied mosaic. No simple land this, but
a complexity of plains, mountains, and desert, all of which color its
history. The Indians no longer inhabit their villages, the Spanish no longer
struggle along the Jornada del Muerto, and the free range of the cattle
baron is gone, but if the traveler sees it through its historical past, it will
again come alive.</p>
<h4>West-Central New Mexico</h4>
<p>This section is a complex and colorful mass of landforms scattered
helter-skelter across the western part of the state. It stretches from the
green Rio Grande Valley, with its irrigated lands, quaint farms, and
picturesque agricultural villages, up the Valley&rsquo;s steep western slopes to the
rolling grassland and mesas and alluvial fans, ending in precipitous and
treacherous canyons in the rugged mountains. Socorro Mountain, the
Magdalenas, the San Mateos, the Ladrones, and countless others seem always
to ring the horizon. Some of them are timbered and abound in cool,
refreshing shade and springs; some are harsh and dry. In the west, the
famed San Agustin Plains stretch to the sunset, a wide carpet fringed by
black, timbered hills, site of fabulous cattle drives of a bygone day. The
complexity of the region&rsquo;s geology, scenery, and terrain is matched by an
equally complex history.</p>
<p>The history is a mosaic of many hues, some harsh and stark like its
dry desert mountains, some inviting like the shade and coolness of its
timbered canyons and mountain springs. First were the many diverse and
sometimes hostile Indian cultures. There were peaceful pueblo peoples
tilling their lands, using the Rio Grande&rsquo;s flowing water to produce
abundance. Also, prehistoric village dwellers struggled to create agricultural
societies along the banks of now-dry rivers in the western part of
the region. And there were the fearsome Apache Indians who founded
their homes in the broken mountain fastnesses and added their excitement
and tragedy to the mosaic. So, too, did the Spaniard make his mark and
the Mexican who followed close behind. The place names of the eastern
part of the region are primarily Spanish, although the Spanish found the
area a difficult one in which to maintain themselves. And then the American
came to dominate this land, adding realism and technology.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Finally, two major economic factors left a profound imprint: stock
raising and mining. The first began with the Spanish, was continued by
the Mexicans, and commercialized by the Americans. Everywhere are signs
of this heritage. Mining also played a dominant role, although of a shorter
duration. One can hardly lift his eyes to the hills without seeing signs of
the prospectors shovel or the miner&rsquo;s work. One can hardly converse with
local citizens without discussing mines of the past or mines of the future.
Livestock and minerals, then, are woven through the historical pattern
and are never far from any part of the story.</p>
<p>Let the traveler be aware of several important facts when he passes
through this region. First, this is empty country, an area that has fewer
people now than it had eighty years ago. Its mines are mostly closed and
the towns that grew with the mines are ghosts. One of the most famous
of these is the town of Kelly, a short distance from the community of
Magdalena. Another is Mogollon, off U.S. Highway 180 in the southwestern
part of this region. Either of these will give to the viewer a vivid
picture of the mining camps of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>To the average tourist crossing the San Agustin Plains, they seem
desolate and uninteresting. To the traveler with imagination and knowledge
of the history of this once great inland lake, the trip can be exciting.
He pictures this great basin full of water, forty-five miles long and fifteen
miles wide, and sees mountains covered with blue spruce surrounding the
great lake. His mental motion picture rolls on thousands of years, watching
the water evaporate and the forest of spruce die, to be replaced eventually
by the pi&ntilde;on and juniper now dotting the hills. Grass grew in the old lake
bed, except in the last areas to evaporate, for these had an alkali content
too high for most grasses. The traveler then watches the Indian enter the
scene&mdash;not the pueblo builder, except as a transient, for no water is available.
The nomadic warrior uses the pathway later. In 1774 and in 1776,
he sees several important battles between the Spanish and the Apaches
fought on these Plains. Later, the American cattleman dominates them,
as he does today....</p>
<p>And so the mosaic grows&mdash;Indians, Spanish, Americans, cattle, and
mines&mdash;and the spectacular vistas and the vast emptiness add color and
excitement for the traveler who sees the past with the present.</p>
<h4>Southeast New Mexico</h4>
<p>Much of southeast New Mexico is an extension of the Great Plains,
but it has some rugged mountains and a severe desert in the middle of
which lie White Sands National Monument and the White Sands Missile
Range. Mountain ranges include the Sacramento east of Alamogordo and
the Guadalupe Mountains, in which are located Carlsbad Caverns.</p>
<p>The plains part of this region are devoted to cattle, potash, and oil.
Like the other plains regions of New Mexico, the heritage passed on from
the great cattle empires of bygone days is very strong and detectable in the
people. Since the early 1930&rsquo;s, oil has come to play an increasingly important
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
part in the history of this section. This is especially true near
Hobbs.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig61">
<img src="images/p47.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="800" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="small">(<i>Forest Service, U.S.D.A.</i>)</span><br /><span class="sc">Anyone for a hike?... in the Guadalupe Mountains</span></p>
</div>
<p>The desert region in the western part of this section has clearly defined
aspects of the old and the new. The southern part of the dread Jornado
del Muerto swept across this arid land and only returned to the river near
modern Hatch, or sometimes farther south, near modern Las Cruces, according
to the whim of the river. Here also lies the White Sands National
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
Monument, a desert spot of unusual beauty and interest. Near the Monument,
the White Sands Missile Range stands as an advanced scientific
test center for the most modern of vehicles, the rocket. Near Alamogordo,
another advanced space development and testing facility is located at
Holloman Air Force Base. So the desert is useful, and it is beautiful, and it
is full of tragic history.</p>
<p>This is also Indian land. East of Tularosa is the Mescalero Apache
Indian Reservation. In a way, this region has always belonged to the
Apache, at least since he migrated into New Mexico. The area contained
no sedentary groups and the Apache appropriated it as his own. His
strongholds were in the Guadalupe and Sacramento mountains. The forts
along the Rio Grande, like Forts Fillmore and Selden, were located to
control the Mescalero and other Apache groups. All that remains today are
the Mescaleros.</p>
<p>There was little Spanish influence in this area except near El Paso
and in the Rio Grande Valley. The Spanish were more attracted to the
upper Rio Grande Valley because of the sedentary nature of the Indians of
that region. The southeast underwent its greatest development in the
American period.</p>
<p>Again, sense the mosaic: These are not blends of land and history; they
are sharp and distinct, each with its own character. Search for the history
and the beauty, for they do not come automatically.</p>
<h4>Southwest New Mexico</h4>
<p>Finally, the southwest, another region of harsh desert and cool refreshing
mountains, part of New Mexico&rsquo;s unusual contrast. The country
south of U.S. 70 is Sonoran desert, thinly populated and poorly watered.
To the north of the highway lies one of the most spectacular beauty spots
in the Southwest, the mountains and forests forming the headwaters of
the Gila River. The Gila River flows west across Arizona until it joins the
Colorado River which empties into the Gulf of California.</p>
<p>The Indians in this part of the state fall into two distinct categories:
The builders, known as the Mimbres culture, constructed homes in caves
and along the watercourses of the Gila and Mimbres rivers. They reached
extremely high levels of culture, and then they disappeared. The Apache
Indians, who entered this country at the same time as they did the rest of
New Mexico, were responsible for the end of the farmers and builders, at
least in part. The Apaches were predators and the farmers were peaceful,
unversed in the arts of war. Finally the Apache ruled supreme, and this
region became the most important single stronghold of the Indian. It was
here that Geronimo found sanctuary. But the Apaches, too, were forced
to surrender their claims and were placed on reservations outside this area.</p>
<p>Mining is and has been the main source of wealth. The great open-pit
operation of Kennecott Copper Company is at Santa Rita, east of Silver
City. This is one of the largest open-pit copper mines in North America.
To look into that huge man-made pit is a thrilling experience. This mine
was first opened in 1803 by the Spanish who needed copper badly as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
circulating currency in New Spain (Mexico). For a number of years, the
coins used for money in Mexico were from copper mined in southwestern
New Mexico.</p>
<p>Copper represents only a part of the mining activity in this region.
Famous mining districts in earlier days were at Kingston and Hillsboro,
just east of the Black Range on State Highway 90. These areas produced
considerable quantities of silver. There is some activity yet, but the boom
has long since passed them by, although they are interesting towns to
visit. The trip from U.S. 85 to Silver City via State Highway 90 is one
of the most scenic routes in the state.</p>
<p>In the region north of Silver City lies high mountain country, much of
it preserved as the Gila Wilderness Area. Here a person who wishes the
solitude of forest and mountain, the thrill of trout fishing in a clear cold
stream, and a wealth of wildlife can find his heart&rsquo;s desire. In the heart
of this wilderness, the traveler might well find some of the ancient homes
of the Mimbres people. History and recreation blend into one.</p>
<p class="tb">These complete the mosaic. Everywhere one travels in New Mexico
is enchanting history, in the land and/or in the people. This has not been
an effort to acquaint anyone with the intricate detail of all the history
of every nook and cranny of this land, but these broad strokes made on
the canvas may help the traveler, transient or native, to enjoy himself. Let
him accept the challenge, stop to investigate, search out evidence of the
history that is there in the colorful and changing land itself, the Indian
heritage, the Spanish past, the cattleman&rsquo;s range, the miner&rsquo;s endless
search&mdash;and become enchanted.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">Derricks and Mines</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">George B. Griswold</span></p>
<p>New Mexico is a mineral-rich state. The gross production value of
oil, gas, and minerals was $671 million during 1963, making the state
the sixth ranking mineral producer in the nation. New Mexico ranks
among other states as follows: first in the production of potash, uranium,
perlite, and carbon dioxide; third in helium; fourth in copper; fifth in
natural gas and liquids; and seventh in petroleum. Important amounts
of zinc, lead, gold, silver, magnesium compounds, coal, gypsum, pumice,
and salt are also produced from deposits within New Mexico. The oil
and gas industry holds a dominant position in the state, accounting for
almost two thirds of the value of minerals produced.</p>
<h3 id="c17">OIL AND GAS</h3>
<p>Most of New Mexico&rsquo;s oil and gas are produced in the southeastern
part, south and east of Roswell. The bustling towns of Hobbs, Artesia, and
Lovington, as well as Roswell, are headquarters for the many oil companies
and the associated service and supply organizations operating in the area.
Oil and gas are produced from numerous reservoirs, called <i>fields</i> or <i>pools</i>,
in Paleozoic sediments ranging from Ordovician to Permian in age. From
the standpoint of production, the Eunice-Monument field (lying between
these two towns) is the largest, having produced more than 250 million
barrels of oil. Other important fields are Hobbs, Vacuum, Langlie Mattix,
Denton, and Jalmat. All these fields produce a considerable amount of gas
associated directly with the oil.</p>
<p>When driving an automobile through southeast New Mexico, a layman
finds it difficult to comprehend the immensity of the petroleum industry
of that region. This is due to the scattering of wells over a large
area. Seldom are wells spaced closer than one to every ten acres, even
in the most productive fields. There are, in fact, some 16,000 wells in this
part of New Mexico, ranging in depth from less than 1000 feet to 17,555
feet.</p>
<p>The other oil- and gas-producing area of the state is in the northwest,
in the San Juan Basin. Farmington serves as the base of operations for
most of this activity. In 1962, there were 7378 wells in the area, 1770 of
which were producing oil and gas and 5608 producing gas only. Most of
the San Juan Basin production is from Cretaceous sandstones, in contrast
to the southeast where the oil and gas are derived from Paleozoic sediments.
The development of the San Juan Basin production is relatively
new; most of the wells have been drilled since World War II. The petroleum
industry can be proud of the great help it has given to the development
of this once-almost-forgotten part of the state.</p>

</div>
<p>The methods of finding and producing oil and gas have come a long
way from the &ldquo;boom town&rdquo; days when wells were drilled for the most part
on pure hunches and hopes. The exploration and exploitation of petroleum
are now highly specialized technologies. All branches of the geologic and
geophysical sciences are brought into play to piece together a comprehensive
picture of all the factors which may have made a certain area favorable
for the accumulation of oil or gas. These factors include such things
as the age, thickness, and permeability of the sedimentary rocks, the structure,
old shorelines, and buried reefs. Once a target is selected, a drilling
rig is moved onto the location to prove or disprove the theory. This is the
costly step of finding oil. A single 10,000-foot hole may cost $350,000, and
some individual wells in New Mexico have cost more than $1 million to
drill. If the well is in a completely untested area, it is called a &ldquo;wildcat.&rdquo;
Once a discovery is made, then the land around the wildcat is explored
by &ldquo;offset&rdquo; wells until the complete extent of the new field is proved.</p>
<p>During 1962, 1666 wells were drilled to an average depth of 5153
feet. The average drilling cost was $71,000 a well, representing a total
investment of almost $120 million in a single year! Most of these wells
were of the development (offset) type, but even then, 27 per cent were
dry. During 1962, 295 true wildcats were drilled; of these, only 46 found
oil or gas&mdash;about two out of every thirteen.</p>
<p>The story of oil just begins with the discovery of a well. Various special
&ldquo;completion&rdquo; operations are applied to the oil-producing horizon so as to increase
the flow into the well. The most common techniques are either by
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
&ldquo;acidizing,&rdquo; pumping acid into the
formation to increase flow by enlarging
the pores in the rock, or
by &ldquo;hydrafracing,&rdquo; whereby actual
cracks are induced in the formation
by pumping oil from the surface
back into the well under very
high pressure. After the well is
&ldquo;completed,&rdquo; it may be a natural-flowing
well if sufficient gas is
associated with the oil. If sufficient
gas is not present, then the well
is pumped.</p>
<p>In recent years, considerable
success has been achieved in revitalizing
old fields where production
had dropped below the point
of economic operation. These fields
are reactivated by forcing either
water or gas down selected wells
within the field, thereby forcing
stagnated oil within the producing
zone toward the other wells. This
technique is called <i>secondary recovery</i>.
Many fields will produce
more oil under the secondary recovery
program than they did during their primary life.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig65">
<img src="images/p50.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="799" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Here&rsquo;s a wildcat for you!</span></p>
</div>
<p>Once the oil is on the surface, it passes through separators to remove
any admixed gas from the oil. The gas is sent into pipelines while the oil
is sent to storage tanks called <i>tank batteries</i>. Periodically, the oil is drawn
from the tank batteries where it is transported by pipeline or rail to refineries.
The great bulk of the crude oil leaves New Mexico for refining
via a major pipeline network extending through Texas to both the Gulf
and East coasts. Some oil is refined in New Mexico, however. Oil refineries
in Artesia, Bloomfield, Ciniza, Farmington, and Monument have a combined
capacity to treat some 30,000 barrels (42 gallons a barrel) of crude
oil a day. On the other hand, practically all the natural gas is treated in
New Mexico so as to recover its liquid petroleum constituents before
sending it out of the state by pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="c18">MINING</h3>
<p>The mining industry of New Mexico dates back to the days of Spanish
rule. Copper was mined from the Santa Rita mine as early as 1800 for
shipment to Mexico for use in coinage. Significant mining in New Mexico
did not commence, however, until the late 1800&rsquo;s. There are three major
centers today: Carlsbad, potash; Silver City area, copper, zinc, and lead;
and Grants, uranium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<div class="img" id="fig66">
<img src="images/p50a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="561" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Question: where are the other oil pumps and tanks in the San Juan Basin?</span></p>
</div>
<p>The potash mining east of Carlsbad, a $75 million-a-year industry employing
more than 3600 persons, is the largest operation of its kind in the
world. Six mining companies are active in the area, and a seventh is
developing yet another mine. <i>Potash</i> is a word used to denote various
potassium compounds. The principal ore mineral at Carlsbad is sylvanite,
a mixture of potassium chloride and sodium chloride (common salt). The
ore contains the equivalent of 21 to 25 per cent potassium oxide (K&#8322;O).<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
Another ore mineral, known as <i>langbeinite</i>, a double salt of potassium and
magnesium sulfate, is also mined.</p>
<p>The potash ores occur as horizontal beds sandwiched between thick
salt and anhydrite layers. These beds are the result of evaporation of large
quantities of salt waters during the latter part of the Permian period some
240 million years ago. The potash-bearing horizons now are buried from
900 to 1800 feet below the surface. The discovery of potash in southeast
New Mexico was almost by accident. In 1925, the Snowden and McSweeny
Company drilled a wildcat oil test a few miles east of Carlsbad.
The hole was dry, but potash minerals were detected in the drill cuttings.
The discovery generated considerable interest because the United States
was forced to import most of its potash prior to this time. Further drilling
proved the existence of tremendous deposits of potassium salts in that area.</p>
<p>The potash mines are among the most highly mechanized of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
mineral industry. Access to the buried deposits is gained by vertical shafts.
Actual mining is now done to a large extent by continuous miners, machines
which bore or rip the potash ore from the face and load it into
shuttle cars in one continuous operation. The shuttle cars then transport
the ore to conveyor belts which move it to the shafts for hoisting. Working
conditions and safety are excellent and have led to high productivity from
these mines.</p>
<p>The potash ore is refined or processed by fractional crystallation or
flotation. These plants remove most of the unwanted sodium chloride
and other gangue minerals to produce high-quality potassium chloride or
sulfate. After processing, the potash salts are stored in giant bins to await
shipment by rail to the major agriculture areas of the United States. The
Carlsbad mines produce some 15 million tons of ore a year which, when
refined, produces 4 million tons of marketable potassium salts having
a K&#8322;O equivalent of 2.5 million tons.</p>

</div>
<p>Uranium mining is the newest major industry in New Mexico. The
boom started in 1950 with the discovery of uranium ore west of Grants
by a Navajo sheep rancher named Paddy Martinez. This discovery started
one of the most extensive exploration and development campaigns in all
mining history. By 1957, the area had proved uranium reserves accounting
for more than half of the entire reserve of the nation. These discoveries
will make this country self-sufficient in this vital atomic energy metal for
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
years to come. Five mills were built that are capable of producing &ldquo;yellow
cake&rdquo; (almost pure uranium oxide) from uranium ores containing as little
as 0.20 per cent U&#8323;O&#8328;. Four mills are located in the Grants area, ranging
in capacity from 1500 to 4000 tons a day. The fifth mill, rated at 500 tons
a day, is at Shiprock.</p>
<p>There are numerous mines, ranging from tiny two-man operations up to
great mines producing more than 1000 tons a day. The most prolific
producing area is the Ambrosia Lake District north of Grants; most of
these mines are underground. Probably the largest single uranium mine,
however, is the open-pit Jackpile-Paguate mine of the Anaconda Company
on the Laguna Indian Reservation some thirty miles east of Grants. The
mine uses electric shovels capable of loading eight cubic yards of ore at
a time into large diesel trucks.</p>
<p>Copper is produced from the Chino mine located at Santa Rita, about
fifteen miles east of Silver City. This mine, operated by Kennecott Copper
Corporation, is the showpiece of the New Mexico minerals industry. The
copper ore is low grade, containing only sixteen pounds a ton of the red
metal, but the deposit is immense, allowing the mining of 22,500 tons a
day. The Chino is by far the largest single mining operation in the state.
A large concentrator and smelter are located at Hurley, about ten miles
southwest of the pit.</p>
<p>The Chino pit is a spectacular sight for its scenic setting and its sheer
size. The deposit is located below the Kneeling Nun, a famous natural
statue formed by the erosion of a rhyolite flow which caps a high mesa. The
pit covers almost one square mile and is 800 feet deep. The mining is
highly mechanized. Large rotary drills make blast holes twelve inches in
diameter into which explosives are loaded. A single blast may break
100,000 tons of rock. The ore is loaded with 8-cubic-yard shovels into
large trucks carrying from 25 to 65 tons each. The trucks transport the ore
to an inclined skipway on the west end of the pit. The skip then carries
the ore up to the train level where it is transferred into railroad cars for
shipment to the mill. Waste rock, too low-grade to justify sending to the
mill, is transported to the very top of the skip way, where it is trucked to
the dumps. At Chino, much of the waste rock contains some copper. The
amount is small, but a part of it can be recovered by leaching-percolating
water down through the rock to dissolve the copper. At the bottom of the
dumps, the copper-rich water is collected and sent through precipitating
tanks containing scrap iron. The copper plates out on the iron, forming
metallic copper. The dump-leaching program alone at Chino is a substantial
enterprise.</p>
<p>The concentrator and smelter at Hurley is the facility which reduces
the low-grade ore into pure metal. The concentrator first crushes and
grinds the ore, then recovers the copper-bearing minerals (principally
chalcocite and chalcopyrite) by flotation. The concentrate of these copper
sulfides is taken to the smelter to make metallic copper.</p>
<p>North and west of the Chino mine are important deposits of zinc
and lead. Two underground mines are now active: the Hanover of the
New Jersey Zinc Company and the Kearney&mdash;Pewabic of American&mdash;Peru
Mining Company. Although dwarfed by the Chino mine, these are important
producers.</p>

</div>
<p>Copper, potash, and uranium are not the only mining operations of
New Mexico. Perlite is recovered from deposits near No Agua in Taos
County and just north of Grants. Two new gypsum plants are now operating
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
northeast of Albuquerque, and a cement plant is located east of that
city. High-grade copper veins are worked south of Lordsburg. Coal mining
is being reactivated, with producing mines near Gallup, Fruitland, and
Raton. A new molybdenum mine is under development east of Questa.
New Mexico&rsquo;s mineral industry is on a broad and firm base.</p>
<p>Mines and derricks are ever-present aspects of New Mexico&rsquo;s landscapes;
they are seen by every citizen of the state and every tourist as he
travels across the plains, valleys, and mountains. The derricks and the
mine openings are merely surface features through which the vast wealth
of the underground is exploited, but they are a monetarily important part
of New Mexico&rsquo;s scenery, rocks, and history.</p>

<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">Enchanting Landscapes</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>by</i> <span class="sc">Frank E. Kottlowski</span></p>
<p>The visitor and the native may be well acquainted with the more
famous scenic places in New Mexico. Most of these are National or State
Parks or Monuments&mdash;glistening dunes of White Sands, sandstone cliffs
of El Morro, canyons eroded in volcanic rocks of Bandelier, the recent
volcano of Capulin Mountain, multicolored sinkholes at Bottomless Lakes,
grotesque carvings of volcanic rocks at City of Rocks, and the black tongues
of cooled lava in the Valley of Fires State Park near Carrizozo.</p>
<p>Many of the lesser-known spectacular scenic areas are off the beaten
path, far from the seventy-mile-an-hour Interstate highways. Even a brief
description of all would fill a thick book. But near the most traveled routes
are numerous enchanting landscapes. The traveler from the midwest or
east, driving U.S. Highway 66 (Interstate 40) breaks over the edge of
the &ldquo;caprock&rdquo; a few miles east of the New Mexico&mdash;Texas line. Atop the
caprock is Llano Estacado, the Staked Plains, a level surface stretching
along the southeast edge of New Mexico eastward into Texas. As seen
south of Tucumcari near Ragland, east of Fort Sumner near Taiban, or
east of Roswell near Kenna and Caprock, the bluffs of the Llano Estacado
are topped by caprock, a cliff of white caliche-limestone as much as forty
feet thick in places. Below, on gentle to steep slopes reaching northward
toward Tucumcari or westward toward Fort Sumner and Roswell, are the
varicolored red, purple, green, and gray shales and sandstones of Triassic
age. Red Lake near Taiban on U.S. Highway 60-84 lies in the red muds
of these Triassic rocks.</p>
<p>South of Tucumcari, rising boldly from the red-earth lowlands draining
to the Canadian River, are Tucumcari Mountain and Mesa Redonda,
and to the northwest the long buff cliffs of Mesa Rica. The latter mesa
lies north of Interstate 40 as far west as Newkirk. Patches of the white
caprock caliche-limestone cap these eastern New Mexico sentinels, whereas
in other localities, the brown Dakota Sandstone tops the buttes and is
underlain by pink Jurassic sandstones, with the mesa bases made up of the
Triassic redbeds.</p>
<p>Near Santa Rosa, Interstate 40 dips down into the narrow green valley
of Rio Pecos. Roadcuts lining the steep hills into the city show the red
and brown sandstones and shales of the Triassic beds.</p>
<p>Driving westward from Santa Rosa, one crosses rolling hills near Clines
Corners, then dips gently down into the northern part of the Estancia
Basin near Moriarty. To the north on the horizon are the snow-capped
peaks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. From Moriarty, Interstate 40
pulls slowly upward toward Edgewood into the eastern foothills of the
Sandia Mountains, the grassy plains giving way to juniper and pi&ntilde;on
groves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>From the downgrade into Tijeras Canyon, State Highway 10 leads
north to San Antonito and the turnoff to Sandia Crest. The crest road
winds up canyon walls, on sloping limestone mesas, up through thick
stands of ponderosa pine, aspen, and, near the top, Engelmann spruce and
corkbark fir. Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep may be seen off the road
on the high crags. From Sandia Crest, 10,678 feet above sea level, much
of north-central New Mexico is visible; Mount Taylor to the west, the
Nacimiento and Jemez mountains to the northwest, the mighty Sangre de
Cristo Mountains to the northeast, and countless ranges to the south and
southwest. The city of Albuquerque is spread out at the base of the
Sandias, and the twisting north-south channel of the Rio Grande stretches,
glistening, as far left and right as one can see.</p>
<p>From Tijeras, Interstate 40 plunges into Tijeras Canyon, slicing through
vertical roadcuts in Pennsylvanian limestones and shales, then through the
ancient Precambrian granite. At the canyons mouth, the road levels off
on the broad alluvial plain on which much of east Albuquerque is built,
although the &ldquo;downtown&rdquo; is really down, in the valley of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Westward, Interstate 40 rolls up out of the valley, crosses windswept
plains spotted with black volcanic cones, in and out of the shallow brown
valley of Rio Puerco, and then to the red-cliff-bordered valley of Rio
San Jose. Cliffs are of brown, buff, and light-gray Jurassic sandstones, with
the valley carved in Triassic redbeds. Near Laguna, on the north side
of the valley, white gypsum of the Todilto Formation crops out. Then
through the pink Jurassic cliffs the canyon winds, and near New Laguna,
the highway is bordered by the varicolored, uranium-bearing Morrison
beds, which are overlain by brown sandstones and black shales of Cretaceous
age.</p>
<p>But as Interstate 40 approaches Grants, the dominant feature is black
frozen lava. The mesas surrounding Mount Taylor are capped by black
basalt, built up in many layers, each individual flows, and loose blocks
tumble down on the hillsides. Young basalt, twisted and wrinkled as if
it were still hot, winds along the valley; just east of Grants, a huge &ldquo;field&rdquo;
of this recent basalt stretches southward beyond the horizon. And above
all looms Mount Taylor, remnant of an ancient volcano, snow-capped
in winter, towering 11,389 feet above sea level.</p>
<p>At Casa Blanca, southeast of Mount Taylor, State Road 23 leads south
to Acoma Pueblo. Eleven miles to the southwest, Enchanted Mesa, <i>Katsim</i>
as it is called by the Acomas, towers 450 feet above the surrounding
valley floor. This sheer-cliffed rock is built by layers of (from the base to
the top) pink and white Entrada Sandstone, gray Todilto limestone, pink
and green Summerville beds, a massive cliff of light-tan Zuni Sandstone,
and a cap of yellow-brown Dakota Sandstone.</p>
<p>The top of Enchanted Mesa is inaccessible by normal means. Legend
has it that once the Acomas lived there, and there are Indian ruins up on
the isolated rim. A terrific rain and lightning storm, one summer day, sent
huge waterfalls down the sides of the mesa, tearing away large blocks
of sandstone, and destroyed the trail to the top, a series of narrow zigzag
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
ledges and toeholds in crevasses. Thus the Acoma Indians moved a few
miles to the southwest to Acoma, onto the top of another sheer cliff, a rock
fortress carved in Zuni Sandstone and capped by Dakota Sandstone.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig70">

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Talk about wide open spaces ... around the Enchanted Mesa</span></p>
</div>
<p>Southwest of Grants, the forested Zuni Mountains rise, bordered on
the north by a valley cut in Triassic redbeds and on the east by the recent
black basalt flows. The hurrying traveler will follow Interstate 40 to
Gallup around the north edge of the Zuni dome, flanked on the north
by the spectacular pink, red, brown, and gray cliffs of Jurassic and Cretaceous
sandstones. If one has time, take the low road, State Highways 53
and 36, around the southern edge of the Zunis. For almost twenty miles,
passing through San Rafael, the paved highway parallels the west edge of
the Grants black basalt flow; then up over low ridges and past black cinder
cones toward El Morro. In the lava tunnels, perpetual ice stays hidden from
the sun; these can be visited at Ice Caves.</p>
<p>El Morro, Inscription Rock, with its towering cliffs of Zuni Sandstone,
overlooks peaceful green valleys; farther west, the red and brown sandstones
are carved into many mesas and buttes near Zuni Pueblo. Then
northward to Gallup, swinging around the west edge of the Zuni Mountains,
the roller-coaster highway, State 36, cuts through ponderosa pine
country, bordered by Cretaceous brown sandstones, black shales, and coal
beds.</p>
<p>Northeast of Gallup eight miles is Kit Carson&rsquo;s Cave, a gaping door
on the face of a massive cliff of Jurassic sandstone. A pool of cool water
lies along its floor. The three-and-a-half-mile drive north of Interstate 40
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
is through a vast broken country of sandstone spires, pyramids, cliffs, and
ledges carved in the Jurassic rocks. Near Gallup, the drab coal-bearing
Cretaceous beds form the landscapes, but westward near the Arizona line,
erosion has cut down again to the brilliantly colored Jurassic rocks, and
Interstate 40 is escorted westward into the Grand Canyon State by cliffs
of white and pink sandstone.</p>
<p>Californians crossing New Mexico in the winter are likely to travel
U.S. Highway 70-80 (Interstate 10) eastward. New Mexico is entered
just before Steins Pass, which is channeled through the tan and green
volcanic rocks of the Peloncillo Mountains. Then down across the mud
and salt marshes of Alkali Flats lying in the Animas Valley and up onto
the north edge of the Pyramid Mountains into Lordsburg. Mine dumps dot
the Pyramids, and the ghost mining town of Shakespeare lies amid the
purple volcanic rocks.</p>
<p>Eastward from Lordsburg for 118 miles are the Antelope Plains; plains,
plains, plains. Steers graze on the sparse grass, yucca clumps border the
highway, and here and there sand dunes flee before the restless winds.
Mountain ranges, like islands on the sea of grass, yucca, and creosote
bush, rise in the distance. West of Deming, the low Victorio Mountains
lie south of the highway, made up of dolomite, limestone, and andesite
ridges. Southeast of Deming are the lofty Florida Mountains, their northern
toe crossed by Interstate 10. Volcanic hills dot the landscape east of
Las Cruces, Sierra de las Uvas&rsquo; purple slopes to the north, and the Potrillo
Mountains and Mount Riley to the south. The latter are part of a spectacular
volcanic field where black cinder cones and basalt flows cover hundreds
of square miles, and craters such as Kilbourne Hole are sunk below
the plains.</p>
<p>The descent into the Rio Grande Valley is awesome, especially if the
late afternoon sun is dancing on the spires and cliffs of the Organ Mountains
to the east. From across the brown plains, Interstate 10 winds down
into the green Mesilla Valley, a different world of cotton and alfalfa fields,
pecan and cottonwood groves, and red-tile-roofed Spanish homes. The
view of the Organ Mountains alone is worth the trip.</p>
<p>At Las Cruces, a city booming on cotton, rockets, and tourists, Interstate
10 turns south to parallel the east side of the Rio Grande Valley
down to Texas and El Paso. If one prefers a quiet scenic route, State
Highway 28 winds its way along the west side of the Valley amid fields
and groves, through peaceful villages, to end at the bridge over the Rio
Grande on the edge of El Paso. Here, to the south, is El Cristo Rey, a cone
of massive andesite, flanked by steeply tilted beds of limestone and shale,
Early Cretaceous in age, cut in two by the New Mexico-Mexico border.
Atop the peak is a 29-foot-high, 40-ton, limestone statue of Christ; a
winding path leads upward from the base for those strong enough of limb
to make the climb. Beyond, to the south, Ciudad Juarez lies, famous for
its bordertown flavor, markets, cathedrals, and bull rings.</p>
<p>The traveler to the east should stay on U.S. 62-180 from El Paso. This
highway cuts through the Hueco Mountains via Powwow Canyon, a gash
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
carved from Pennsylvanian and Permian limestones, crosses the Diablo
Plateau, rolls past the white patches of Salt Flat lakes, then winds up to
the summit of Guadalupe Pass between the Delaware Mountains on the
south and the towering Guadalupe Mountains on the north. Looking
north from the Pass, Guadalupe Peak, highest point in Texas, and El
Capitan are unforgettable sights, their steep lower slopes ribbed brown and
green, overshadowed by the 1000-foot limestone cliffs of the peaks. The
limestone-hewn Guadalupe Mountains parallel the highway in New Mexico
and are pitted with many caves, with Carlsbad Caverns the largest
known in the range. Eastward beyond the Pecos Valley stretches the Great
Plains and Texas.</p>
<p>A side trip, near Carlsbad, over black-topped and gravel roads leads
from Seven Rivers, up Rocky Arroyo on State Road 137, into the northern
foothills of the Guadalupe Mountains to Sitting Bull Falls. Here, cool
spring waters cascade over limestone ledges to join in green pools lying
amid the cottonwood groves of the canyon floor.</p>
<p>Lake McMillan, a reservoir along the Pecos River north of Carlsbad,
and the many potash mines east of Carlsbad are parts of the enchanting
landscapes of this southeastern corner. Northward, following the green
cotton fields bordering the Pecos River, U.S. Highway 285 leads through
Artesia with its oil refineries to modern booming Roswell, second
city of the state. East of Roswell, bordering the east side of the Pecos
Valley, is Bottomless Lakes, azure blue pools spotted in sink holes.</p>
<p>Eastward from Roswell, on either U.S. Highway 70 or 380, redbeds
of Permian and Triassic age lie half hidden by pinkish sands up to the
edge of the caprock; beyond are the fertile grazing and crop lands of the
Llano Estacado, with its queen cities of Clovis and Portales. Here, deep
wells pump underground waters to irrigate lush fields that produce peanuts,
tomatoes, sweet potatoes, melons, strawberries, cucumbers, and
grapes. On the plains beyond the reach of the wells, wheat, maize, and
broomcorn are grown. Southeastward, oil derricks dot the plains, surrounding
Hobbs and Lovington.</p>
<p>Westward from Roswell, U.S. Highways 70 and 380 run together up
the rolling limestone hills west of the Pecos Valley before plunging down
Picacho Hill into the narrow canyon of Rio Hondo. At Hondo they
divide. U.S. Highway 380 leads northwestward through Lincoln town,
Billy the Kid&rsquo;s shooting grounds, into Capitan, over Indian Divide, and
down into sleepy Carrizozo&mdash;paralleled by the forested peaks of Capitan
Mountains to the north and overshadowed by mighty Sierra Blanca to the
southwest. U.S. Highway 70 runs up the green canyon of Rio Ruidoso,
past Ruidoso Downs, past State Highway 37 which leads to Ruidoso and
the Sierra Blanca Ski Area, up into the ponderosa pines, crossing the divide
at Apache Summit, then westward and downhill past Mescalero, paralleling
Rio Tularosa. Suddenly the canyon widens, and ahead is the dry
Tularosa Basin with the White Sands glistening in the far distance.</p>

</div>
<p>From Tularosa to Alamogordo, U.S. Highway 70 is along the west
edge of the Sacramento Mountains wherein tier upon tier of dolomite
and limestone cliffs rise to the high peaks near Cloudcroft. Southwestward
from Alamogordo, the highway cuts diagonally across the Tularosa Basin,
skirting the southern edge of the White Sands, and passing through White
Sands Missile Range. Ahead lie the fabulous spires of the Organ Mountains;
to the right, the notched cliffs of the San Andres Mountains stretch
northward to rounded Salinas Peak and beyond the horizon. Steeply, the
highway rises to cross San Augustin Pass between the Organ and San
Andres mountains, past the village of Organ with its crumbling mining
dumps, before plunging downward onto the southern end of Jornada del
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
Muerto, and finally, on the east edge of Las Cruces, leaves the creosote
bush plains to dip into the green Mesilla Valley of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>West of Carrizozo, U.S. 380 crosses the black basalt flows of Valley of
Fires State Park, curves over the Carrizozo dome and up the dip slopes
of Chupadera Mesa, crosses in red roadcuts the northern tip of Sierra
Oscura, then westward through sand dunes of the northern Jornada del
Muerto. Coal beds crop out at Cerro Colorado before the highway sweeps
down into the Rio Grande Valley to San Antonio.</p>
<p>U.S. Highway 60 enters the state from the east on the Staked Plains
near booming Clovis, crosses Rio Pecos Valley at Fort Sumner&mdash;near Billy
the Kid&rsquo;s grave&mdash;goes straight as a beeline over the plains to Vaughn, then
crosses the low southern end of the Pedernal Hills where tan Permian
sandstones lie abruptly on Precambrian granite, quartzite, and schists. Near
Willard, the highway crosses the southern end of the Estancia Valley,
with the salt lakes of Laguna del Perro mere remnants of the huge Pleistocene
lake that once filled the Valley. West from Mountainair, Abo redbeds
border the highway; limestone walls of Gran Quivira lie to the south
and the red sandstone church ruins of Abo and Quarai are to the north.
Through Abo Pass between the Manzano and Los Pinos mountains the
highway runs, then down the long alluvial fan slopes to the Rio Grande
Valley at Bernardo. From Bernardo to Socorro, U.S. Highway 60 joins
Interstate 25; westward from Socorro, the road climbs out of the Valley
onto Snake Ranch Flats, parallels the snow-tipped Magdalena Mountains
to Magdalena, then crosses the north end of the grassy San Agustin Plains.
Westward to Datil and Quemado, the highway is always in sight of volcanic
mountains, up and down winding canyons, and across intermontane
plains.</p>
<p>Still westward into Arizona along U.S. Highway 60 are Springerville,
fabulous Salt River Canyon, the mining cities of Globe, Miami, and
Superior, and booming Phoenix.</p>
<p>Into this west-central New Mexico country of volcanic peaks and grassy
plains comes U.S. Highway 180 from Deming northwestward. Along
the scenic, winding route are City of Rocks, the copper smelter at Hurley,
Santa Rita&rsquo;s huge open-pit copper mine, famous Silver City, colorful canyons
of the Gila and San Francisco rivers, and, crossed by passes or bordering
all routes, the rugged rhyolite, andesite, and basalt ledges and cliffs.</p>
<p>From El Paso to Raton Pass, 515 miles, U.S. Highway 85 (Interstate
25) crosses New Mexico from south to north, from Mexico to Colorado.
As far as La Bajada Hill, between Albuquerque and Santa Fe, the highway
parallels the Rio Grande. Northward from El Paso, past Las Cruces
to Radium Springs and old Fort Selden, the green Mesilla Valley borders
the route; then through Selden Canyon into the Hatch Valley near San
Diego Mountain, and along the west side of the bold cliffs of the Caballo
Mountains, past Caballo Reservoir to Truth or Consequences (old Hot
Springs). Eastward lies Elephant Butte Dam and reservoir; the road cuts
across alluvial plains to the west of the Rio Grande all the way to Albuquerque,
with the mountains to the west the San Mateo, Magdalena,
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
Socorro, and Ladron and to the east, the Fra Cristobal, Los Pinos, and
Manzano.</p>
<p>Intersecting Interstate 40 at Albuquerque, the Pan-American Central
Highway, Interstate 25 crosses to the east side of the Rio Grande, the
sheer cliffs of the Sandia Mountains to the east and the distant dark green
Jemez Mountains to the northwest. Crossing Galisteo Creek northeast
of Santo Domingo Pueblo, Interstate 25 turns toward the northeast, climbs
La Bajada Hill, onto the green plains sloping from Santa Fe. Santa Fe,
the ancient capital city, is nestled on the edge of the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains. Southeastward and eastward, U.S. Highway 85 (to be Interstate
25 here) rolls, skirting the southern end of the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains, wedged in by the north-facing cliffs of Glorieta Mesa, through
Glorieta Pass, where the Confederates lost the battle for the Southwest,
across the upper reaches of Rio Pecos, and around to Las Vegas. Then in
straight lines across the western edges of the Great Plains where they lap
up onto the Sangre de Cristo ranges, through Wagon Mound and Springer
to Raton. The climb up-canyon to Raton Pass, through roadcuts of brown
sandstone, shale, and coal, leads into Colorado, with a view of much of
southern Colorado from the Pass.</p>
<p>Many routes lead northward from ancient Santa Fe. U.S. Highway
285 crosses the high divide near Bishop&rsquo;s Lodge, follows Rio Tesuque to
Pojoaque, crosses the Rio Grande near Espanola amid varicolored badlands
cut in the Santa Fe rocks, then heads northward on the black basalt plateau
toward Colorado. Black Mesa, a volcanic neck, lies south of Espanola,
overlooking the green Rio Grande Valley; atop this height, Pueblo Indians
once defied Spanish guns until they starved. Northward, near Tres Piedras,
the Ortega and Brazos ranges tower to the west, the perlite-rich hills
of No Agua lie to the northeast, and across the basalt plains cut by the
Rio Grande, the lofty, snow-capped Sangre de Cristo Mountains loom.</p>
<p>At Pojoaque, State Road 4 leads westward, across Otowi bridge of
the Rio Grande, then winds up into the canyon and mesa country bordering
the Jemez Mountains. Herein lie Bandelier and Los Alamos, one
with ancient abandoned pueblos, the other the atomic city. Farther west,
the road crosses the rim of an ancient volcano into Valle Grande, the
crater of that volcano&mdash;some 16 miles across. When this volcano spewed
forth hot ashes about a million years ago, the volcanic dust was wind-blown
as far as Kansas and Nebraska!</p>
<p>At Espanola, U.S. Highway 84 breaks away to the northwest to follow
Rio Chama in its canyon carved from redbeds near Abiquiu, past the
interesting museum at Ghost Ranch&mdash;where bones of Triassic dinosaurs
are collected&mdash;Echo Amphitheater, El Vado Lake, through Chama, and on
up into the San Juan Mountains country of southern Colorado.</p>
<p>Near Espanola, U.S. Highway 64 splits off to the northeast; this is the
high road of north-central New Mexico. Paralleling the canyon of the
Rio Grande to Pilar, the highway climbs up onto the Taos plateau to
Taos, turns eastward to cut through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains over
Palo Flechado Pass, down into the grassy Moreno Valley to Eagle Nest
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
and Eagle Nest Lake, then eastward again following the narrow canyon
of the Cimarron River to Cimarron and Raton. A loop trip northward
from Eagle Nest on State 38 goes through ghost town Elizabethtown, over
Red River Pass, and down the varicolored canyon of Red River to Questa,
before turning southward toward Taos.</p>

</div>
<p>And there is the northwest, the Four Corners region, land of Navajos
and gas wells, presided over by magnificent Shiprock. State Highway 44
leaves Interstate 25 at Bernalillo, follows Rio Salado to San Ysidro, which
nestles at the south tip of the Nacimiento Mountains below White Mesa,
thence northwestward past Cabezon Peak and coaly La Ventana to Cuba
in the valley of Rio Puerco. Then, up and down, the winding highway
cuts transversely across the San Juan Basin, through pine groves at the
Continental Divide, past the side road to Chaco Canyon National Monument
at Blanco Trading Post, and among the multicolored Tertiary beds
carved into badlands. At Bloomfield, oil and gas wells lie all about, and
the mesa-and-canyon country gives way to the valley of the San Juan
River. At Aztec, State Road 44 joins U.S. Highway 550 in the narrow
valley of the Animas River&mdash;a clear cold stream sent rushing down from
the icy lakes of the San Juan Mountains to the north. Eastward a few
miles lies Navajo Lake along the San Juan River; northward, U. S. 550
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
winds up the Animas Valley toward Durango, high Silverton, and Mesa
Verde National Park. Aztec Ruins National Monument is just to the
northwest of Aztec.</p>
<p>Westward from Aztec, U.S. Highway 550 follows the Animas River
to its junction with the San Juan River, then past the huge Navajo coal
mine, a long open cut near Fruitland, to junction with U.S. Highway
666 at Shiprock.</p>
<p>Shiprock! A buttressed needle, towering 1450 vertical feet above Navajo-land,
with walls of black igneous rock radiating from its feet like spokes
on a wheel. This dark-colored spire once filled the throat of a volcano.
Where are piles of rocks, hundreds of feet thick, that once surrounded it?
Down the river they went, down the San Juan to the Colorado River,
and thence to the ocean.</p>
<p>To the west, as a background, are the forested Carrizo, Lukachukai,
and Chuska mountains. Off to the east lies Hogback Mountain, an upturned
ridge of sedimentary rocks producing oil&mdash;the petroleum geologist&rsquo;s
favorite haunt, an anticline.</p>
<p>Southward from Shiprock, U.S. 666 passes other volcanic necks such
as Bennett Peak and Ford Butte. North of Gallup, State Road 68 leads
westward to Window Rock (Arizona), the Indian Headquarters of the
Navajo Reservation. Near Gallup, coal beds of Late Cretaceous age crop
out, Gamerco once being a booming coal-mining town. Now huge dragline
shovels scoop out the coal from open pits to the northwest of Gallup.
And at Gallup, the Indian Capital, a loop drive around the San Juan Basin
is completed; Interstate 40, old U.S. Highway 66, goes eastward to Albuquerque,
St. Louis, and Chicago, and westward to Grand Canyon, Los
Angeles, and the blue Pacific.</p>
<p>Many other scenic places dot the Land of Enchantment; local hosts,
rancher or city dweller, know of these. Mountain meadows, rushing
streams, rocky peaks, desert valleys, badlands, grassy plains, thick forests,
spectacular chasms, needle rocks, and brilliant colors&mdash;they are all here in
New Mexico.</p>

<h2><span class="small"><i><span class="ss">Traveler&rsquo;s-Eye View of New Mexico</span></i></span></h2>
<p>A truly representative picture of New Mexico is presented
in this guide for visitor and resident. The traveler gains a background
knowledge of the State&rsquo;s centuries-old history, desert-to-alpine flora and
fauna, geological past, ancient Indians, and frontier forts. He learns of
the numerous recreational and scenic attractions of its nine National
Monuments, seven Forests, and one Park and nine State Monuments
and twenty-one Parks. Unusual features such as the Antelope Plains,
Ghost Ranch Museum, Sitting Bull Falls, Jackpile open-pit uranium
mine, Jornada del Muerto, and Abo Pass redbeds are described, as are
nineteen Indian pueblos. Routes given include both major highways
and good secondary roads; all are well designated and easy to follow on

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
